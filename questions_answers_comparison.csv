"Hi, I tied gitcoin with my coinbase account. eas shows waiting for proof. How long do I have to wait? Is there an administrator?",This should be fixed now. There was a pause with the indexer api. Attestations were still onchain.,"To address your issue with the ""waiting for proof"" status on EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) after tying your Gitcoin account with Coinbase, let's go through a few steps and considerations:

### Step 1: Verify the Action
First, ensure that you have completed the necessary steps to link your Gitcoin and Coinbase accounts. Make sure you followed the instructions provided by Gitcoin and Coinbase accurately.

### Step 2: Check for Delays
Sometimes, there might be a delay in the attestation process. It could take a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the network congestion and the processing time of the involved services.

### Step 3: Refresh and Retry
Try refreshing the page or logging out and logging back into your Gitcoin account to see if the status updates.

### Step 4: Manual Verification
If the status remains ""waiting for proof"" for an extended period (e.g., more than 24 hours), there could be an issue that requires manual intervention.

### Contact Support
If you've waited for a reasonable amount of time and the status hasn't changed, it's best to reach out to support. You can contact Gitcoin support for assistance. They might have more information or be able to manually verify the attestation for you.

### Escalation
If Gitcoin support cannot resolve the issue, it might need to be escalated to the EAS team. In that case, please provide detailed information about the issue to Gitcoin support, and they can escalate it further if necessary.

If you've already tried waiting and refreshing the status, please let me know, and we can proceed to the next step. If not, please try that first and update me on the outcome."
Can you please share your code? Perhaps a GitHub repo with example?,"I just copied and pasted the example code from the Make an Attestation section, in the ""Example O chain Attestation with the SDK""

I deployed the 3 contracts on ganache locally through remix
Copied the SDK code and just changed the EAS address and schemaUID to the deployed ones

The only difference is the Signer I'm using a private key but I don't think that's the issue 

I also tried calling the function from remix and I also get a Gas error","I don't have a GitHub repository to share directly, but I can certainly provide you with an example code snippet to help you get started with Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) in your project. 

Here's a basic example of how you can create an attestation using EAS in a Node.js environment:

1. **Install the necessary packages:**

   ```bash
   npm install ethers
   npm install ethereum-attestation-service
   ```

2. **Create an attestation:**

   ```javascript
   const { ethers } = require('ethers');
   const { EAS, SchemaEncoder } = require('ethereum-attestation-service');

   // Initialize Ethereum provider
   const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('YOUR_INFURA_OR_ALCHEMY_URL');

   // Define wallet using private key
   const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY';
   const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

   // Initialize EAS with the appropriate contract address
   const eas = new EAS('EAS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS', wallet);

   // Define the schema and encoder
   const schemaEncoder = new SchemaEncoder('string name, uint256 age');
   const schema = schemaEncoder.encodeData(['John Doe', 30]);

   // Create the attestation
   async function createAttestation() {
     try {
       const tx = await eas.attest({
         schema,
         data: {
           recipient: '0xRECIPIENT_ADDRESS',
           expirationTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 1 year from now
           revocable: true,
           refUID: ethers.constants.HashZero,
           data: schema,
         },
       });

       console.log('Attestation transaction sent:', tx.hash);
       await tx.wait();
       console.log('Attestation confirmed:', tx.hash);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error creating attestation:', error);
     }
   }

   createAttestation();
   ```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_INFURA_OR_ALCHEMY_URL'`, `'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'`, `'EAS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'`, and `'0xRECIPIENT_ADDRESS'` with your actual data.

### Notes:
- This example assumes you are familiar with Ethereum development and have set up an Infura or Alchemy account to get the provider URL.
- Make sure your wallet has sufficient ETH to cover the gas fees for the transaction.
- Adjust the schema as needed to fit the structure of the data you want to attest.

Can a resolver address take an action when an attestation is revoked?,"Yes there is a  | {'type': 'code', 'text': 'onRevoke'} |  function that you could add to your schema resolver

 | {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-contracts/blob/62536759886d4a0f3d4ab01710eaa23031459e0b/contracts/resolver/examples/TokenResolver.sol#L35-L37'}","In the context of the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), a resolver can indeed take action when an attestation is revoked. Specifically, when an attestation is revoked, the resolver contract can be designed to handle such events and execute specific logic in response.

Here’s how you can set up a resolver to take action upon attestation revocation:

1. **Implementing the Resolver Contract:**
   Define a resolver contract that inherits from the EAS resolver interface. In this contract, you can include logic to handle the revocation event.

2. **Revocation Handling:**
   Within the resolver, implement a function to handle the revocation logic. This function can be triggered when the attestation is revoked.

Here’s a simplified example of what the resolver contract might look like:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import ""eas/contracts/IResolver.sol""; // Import the EAS resolver interface

contract MyResolver is IResolver {
    event AttestationRevoked(address indexed from, uint256 attestationId);

    // This function will be called when an attestation is revoked
    function onRevoke(uint256 attestationId) external {
        // Implement your logic here
        // For example, you might want to emit an event
        emit AttestationRevoked(msg.sender, attestationId);

        // Additional logic can be added here
    }
}
```

3. **Connecting the Resolver to EAS:**
   Deploy the resolver contract and then link it to the EAS system. Ensure that the EAS system is aware of your resolver so it can call the `onRevoke` function when an attestation is revoked.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your resolver contract will take the desired actions when an attestation is revoked. This can include emitting events, updating state variables, or any other logic specific to your application.

```

2. Set up your EAS SDK with Ethers v5:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require(""ethers"");

Hey all! I was wondering if anyone had examples of getting the EAS SDK up and running with Viem? I saw the wagmi hooks but trying to stick with viem in my stack. I think I'm getting close but keep getting some weird errors about invalid arguments,"The wagmi hooks should work for just viem as well. Check these docs:  | {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/ethers'}","Sure, I can help you with that. It sounds like you're trying to integrate the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) SDK with Viem. Here's a basic example to get you started.

First, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
```sh
npm install @viem/core ethers @eas-sdk/eas
```

Here's a simple example to initialize the EAS SDK with Viem:

```javascript
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'
import { EAS } from '@eas-sdk/eas'
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

// Create a Viem public client
const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'),
})

// Define your provider using Viem
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(client);

// Initialize the EAS SDK
const eas = new EAS(provider);

// Example function to make an attestation
async function createAttestation() {
  try {
    const schema = '0xYourSchemaId' // Replace with your schema ID
    const data = {
      recipient: '0xRecipientAddress', // Replace with the recipient's address
      expirationTime: 0,
      revocable: true,
      refUID: ethers.constants.HashZero,
      data: '0xYourData', // Replace with your attestation data
    };

    const tx = await eas.attest(schema, data);
    console.log('Transaction hash:', tx.hash);

    const receipt = await tx.wait();
    console.log('Transaction confirmed:', receipt);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating attestation:', error);
  }
}

createAttestation();
```

In this example:
- We use Viem to create a public client connected to the Ethereum mainnet.
- We use the `ethers` provider to initialize the EAS SDK.
- The `createAttestation` function demonstrates how to create an attestation with the EAS SDK.

"Hi everyone, is the Coinbase Onchain Verifications (Additional Rewards) track of the Onchain Summer Buildathon different from the EAS Attestation Summer? Can we build 1 project and apply into two hackathons ?",Yes they are separate! You can apply to both hackathons with the same idea.,"The Coinbase Onchain Verifications (Additional Rewards) track of the Onchain Summer Buildathon and the EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) Attestation Summer are indeed separate hackathons with different focuses and possibly different sets of requirements and judging criteria.

1. **Coinbase Onchain Verifications (Additional Rewards) Track:**
   - This track is part of the broader Onchain Summer Buildathon organized by Coinbase. It focuses on projects that leverage on-chain verification mechanisms, possibly using Coinbase's infrastructure or APIs.
   - This track likely has its own set of rules, judging criteria, and reward structure.

2. **EAS Attestation Summer:**
   - This hackathon is centered around building projects that utilize the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). It specifically encourages the use of EAS for creating attestations on the Ethereum blockchain.
   - This event will have its own unique guidelines, judging criteria, and rewards.

### Building One Project for Both Hackathons

Yes, you can build one project and apply to both hackathons, provided that your project meets the criteria and requirements of both events. This is a common practice in hackathons where a single project can fit into the themes of multiple tracks or events. Here are some steps to ensure you're compliant:

1. **Align Project Goals:**
   - Ensure your project aligns with the goals and requirements of both hackathons.
   - For the Coinbase track, focus on integrating on-chain verification features.
   - For the EAS Attestation Summer, ensure you are utilizing the EAS for attestations effectively.

2. **Review Guidelines:**
   - Carefully review the guidelines, rules, and submission processes for both hackathons. Make sure you adhere to any specific requirements or exclusions.

3. **Dual Submission:**
   - Prepare your submission materials (e.g., project description, demo video, code repository) to address the judging criteria of both hackathons.
   - Submit to both tracks separately, ensuring each submission is tailored to highlight how your project fits into the respective hackathon's focus.

### Important Considerations

- **Intellectual Property:** Ensure there are no conflicting terms regarding intellectual property rights or project ownership between the two hackathons.
- **Disclosure:** Be transparent in your submissions about participating in multiple hackathons. Some events may require disclosure if the project is submitted elsewhere.

If you need specific information from the official rules or guidelines of either hackathon, please refer to their official documentation or websites. If you have further questions or need specific advice, feel free to ask!"
"Hi team, I'm wondering which is the more useful data to store to preserve the underlying data if we are otherwise ipfs indexing it.

Is it better to consider the offchainAttestation the source of truth for the attestation, or the createOffchainUrl(sig, signer) path as the source of truth?

It seems that the offchainAttestation object is the actual 712 signed message, but the offchainUrl is slightly more usable and should contain within it the offchainAttestation as a parseable sub object, even if EAS stopped hosting its FE. Is that correct?",i'd think so  because unpublished attestations can be passed around via the url only. but would love to get clarification from the team as well | Either is okay since they can be converted back and forth,"Hi there! Let's break down your question and address the key points regarding the use of `offchainAttestation` and `createOffchainUrl(sig, signer)` in the context of preserving underlying data when using IPFS for indexing.

### Understanding `offchainAttestation` and `createOffchainUrl`

1. **`offchainAttestation`**: This object represents the actual EIP-712 signed message. It contains the raw data of the attestation, which includes details like the schema, recipient, expiration time, and the signature itself. It is the fundamental piece of data that validates the attestation.

2. **`createOffchainUrl(sig, signer)`**: This function generates a URL that can be used to retrieve the attestation data. The URL typically encodes the signed attestation in a way that can be easily parsed and verified.

### Source of Truth

The choice between using `offchainAttestation` and `createOffchainUrl` as the source of truth depends on several factors:

#### `offchainAttestation` as Source of Truth
- **Pros**:
  - Contains the raw, signed data.
  - Independent of any URL or external hosting service.
  - Directly verifiable using the signature and the EIP-712 standard.
- **Cons**:
  - May require additional processing or tooling to be usable.

#### `createOffchainUrl` as Source of Truth
- **Pros**:
  - Encodes the attestation in a more usable format.
  - Easier to parse and retrieve data.
  - Can contain the `offchainAttestation` as a sub-object, making it self-contained.
- **Cons**:
  - Dependent on the availability of the URL and the hosting service.
  - If EAS stops hosting its front-end, the URL might become less reliable.

### Conclusion

Given your requirements of preserving the underlying data and ensuring usability, it would be prudent to consider the following approach:

1. **Store `offchainAttestation` as the primary source of truth**:
   - This ensures that you have the raw, signed attestation data, which is independent of any external service.

2. **Use `createOffchainUrl` for usability**:
   - While the raw data is stored, generate and store the `createOffchainUrl` for ease of access and usability.

This way, you have the best of both worlds: the raw data for verification and the URL for usability. If the front-end service is ever discontinued, you still have the raw, signed data that can be independently verified and processed.

### Example

Here’s a simplified example of what this might look like in practice:

```javascript
const offchainAttestation = {
  // ... your EIP-712 signed message data
};

const sig = ""0x...""; // Signature of the attestation
const signer = ""0x...""; // Address of the signer

const offchainUrl = createOffchainUrl(sig, signer);

// Store both the offchainAttestation object and the offchainUrl
storeOnIPFS({
  offchainAttestation,
  offchainUrl,
});
```

By storing both the `offchainAttestation` and the generated URL, you ensure data integrity and usability.

For the most accurate information and validation, consider checking insights provided by Steve Dakh, Bryce, or Leonid from EAS, as they are authoritative sources on this topic.

"There are any debates regarding the arguments being hashed in the schemas? Currently only the resolver, abi and revocable are present. But I ran into a situation where I have two schemas that must be revocable, use the same resolver, and need no data types (empty abi), but I can't aggregate them because they mean diferent badges (one is a manager, other is an user). Would be nice to have a naming convention or versioning when generating the schema uid. Is this subjected to debate?",Can you describe your use case so I can help better?,"The issue you're describing touches on a fundamental aspect of schema design and uniqueness in the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). Currently, the schema UID in EAS is generated based on hashing the resolver, ABI, and revocable status. This design ensures that each schema is uniquely identifiable based on these attributes. However, your situation highlights a potential limitation when schemas share these attributes but have different semantic meanings.

### Current Schema UID Generation
The current hashing mechanism for generating the schema UID is as follows:
1. **Resolver**: The contract address that will resolve the attestation.
2. **ABI**: The Application Binary Interface, which in your case is empty.
3. **Revocable**: Whether or not the attestation can be revoked.

### Potential Solutions
To address the issue of semantically different schemas having the same UID, there are a few potential approaches that could be considered:

1. **Adding a Descriptor Field**:
   Introduce an additional field in the schema, such as a descriptor or name, which could be included in the hash. This descriptor can provide a semantic meaning to differentiate between schemas.

   ```solidity
   struct Schema {
       address resolver;
       string abi;
       bool revocable;
       string descriptor; // New field
   }
   ```

2. **Versioning**:
   Implement a versioning system for schemas, where each schema can have a version number included in the hash. This way, even if the resolver, ABI, and revocable status are the same, different versions can be uniquely identified.

   ```solidity
   struct Schema {
       address resolver;
       string abi;
       bool revocable;
       uint256 version; // New field
   }
   ```

3. **Naming Convention**:
   Establish a naming convention for schemas where the name is part of the hashed data. This ensures that even if other attributes are the same, different names will result in different hashes.

   ```solidity
   struct Schema {
       address resolver;
       string abi;
       bool revocable;
       string name; // New field
   }
   ```

### Community and Developer Input
This is a significant consideration that would benefit from community and developer input. As you mentioned, it's a subject that could be open to debate. The Ethereum Attestation Service community, including key contributors like Steve Dakh, Bryce, and Leonid, would be the ideal forum for discussing and implementing such changes.

### Next Steps
1. **Raise the Issue**: Bring this up in the EAS community forums or GitHub issues to get feedback from other developers and contributors.
2. **Propose a Change**: Based on the feedback, propose a change to the schema definition to include additional fields for differentiating schemas.
3. **Consensus and Implementation**: Work towards consensus in the community and implement the agreed-upon changes.

Would you like me to help draft a proposal or point you towards the appropriate forum to raise this issue?"
"Hi team, there are 4 addresses listed for some chains - EAS, SchemaRegistry, EIP712Proxy and then Indexer. why do some chains have only the first two? does this mean they don't support delegated attestations or indexing yet?",All chains support delegated attestations. The EIP712Proxy is only a helper contract. Anyone can deploy it. Same for the indexer but in general we like to deploy an official indexer on each chain. Which chains are you focusing on?,"The presence of different addresses for EAS, SchemaRegistry, EIP712Proxy, and Indexer on certain chains indicates the specific functionalities and features that are supported on those chains.

1. **EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service)**: This address is fundamental and is present on all chains where the EAS protocol is deployed. It is responsible for creating and managing attestations.

2. **SchemaRegistry**: This address is also essential and is present on all chains where EAS is active. It manages the schemas that define the structure and types of attestations that can be created.

3. **EIP712Proxy**: This address is related to delegated attestations. EIP-712 is a standard for hashing and signing typed structured data, which is used for off-chain data signing. If a chain does not have this address, it means that the chain does not support delegated attestations using EIP-712 yet.

4. **Indexer**: This address is related to indexing services, which are used to efficiently query and retrieve attestations. If a chain does not have this address, it means that the chain does not support advanced indexing functionalities yet.

Thus, if some chains only have the first two addresses (EAS and SchemaRegistry), it indicates that these chains currently do not support delegated attestations (EIP712Proxy) and indexing services (Indexer). They only support the basic attestation functionalities provided by EAS.

Would you like more specific information on a particular chain or further details on how these functionalities work?"
Does this offer a model for a user to authorize another EOA to make delegations on their behalf? Or just from the contract address only?,You can accomplish this without the contract using standard delegated attestations. A delegator can sign a delegated attestation which gets paid for by another entity,"The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a flexible framework for creating and managing attestations, including the ability to delegate actions. However, the specifics of how delegation is implemented can vary depending on the use case and the smart contract setup.

To determine whether EAS supports a model for a user to authorize another Externally Owned Account (EOA) to make delegations on their behalf, let’s consider the following points:

1. **Direct EOA Delegation**:
    - If you want users to authorize another EOA to act on their behalf, you typically need a mechanism within the smart contract to handle such delegation. This can be implemented using role-based access control or by maintaining a mapping of delegators to delegates.

2. **Contract-Based Delegation**:
    - Contracts can inherently manage delegated actions by checking the permissions and roles assigned to different addresses. A contract can maintain an internal list of authorized delegates and enforce these rules in its logic.

### Example: EOA Delegation in Solidity

Here is a simplified example of how you might implement EOA delegation in a Solidity contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Delegation {
    mapping(address => address) private delegate;

    // Event to log delegation
    event DelegationSet(address indexed delegator, address indexed delegate);

    // Function to set a delegate
    function setDelegate(address _delegate) external {
        delegate[msg.sender] = _delegate;
        emit DelegationSet(msg.sender, _delegate);
    }

    // Function to get the delegate of a user
    function getDelegate(address _user) external view returns (address) {
        return delegate[_user];
    }

    // Function to perform an action that checks for delegation
    function performAction() external {
        address user = msg.sender;
        address userDelegate = delegate[user];

        // logic to allow delegate to perform action
        if (userDelegate != address(0)) {
            // Perform action on behalf of the user
        } else {
            // Perform action directly
        }
    }
}
```

### Steps to Implement Delegation:

1. **Set Delegate**: Users can call the `setDelegate` function to authorize another EOA to act on their behalf.
2. **Check Delegate**: The contract checks whether the calling address has been delegated the right to perform certain actions.

### Considerations:
- **Security**: Ensure that proper checks are in place to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Revocation**: Provide mechanisms for users to revoke delegation.

### EAS Context:
If EAS provides specific mechanisms or recommendations for delegation, they would likely be detailed in the documentation or by key contributors like Steve Dakh, Bryce, or Leonid.

Would you like to try implementing such a delegation model in your contract? If this approach doesn't fully address your needs, please let me know, and we can explore further options."
"Hi guys, wanted to confirm that there is no way for a resolver contract to make an attestation that references the attestation it is about to resolve? For example, can an order attestation resolver attest (with a different schema) that the order is paid while referencing the soon to be order attestation?",It is true you cannot use refUID this way currently (this may be changed in an upcoming release). Another options is you can compute the UID and attest using a schema that has a bytes32 field referencing the attestation UID. It just wont work with the standard refUID field since the hook will run before the attestation exists.,"Hello! In the context of the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), it's important to note that a resolver contract cannot directly reference or interact with the specific attestation it is about to resolve. This is primarily due to the fact that the attestation process and resolution are two distinct steps and the resolver does not have access to the soon-to-be-created attestation during its own execution.

However, there are ways to manage this workflow indirectly. One approach is to handle the creation of the payment attestation and the order attestation in separate transactions, ensuring that the resolver contract can reference the already existing attestation.

Here’s a step-by-step approach you can consider:

1. **Create the Order Attestation:**
   First, you create the initial order attestation. This attestation will contain all the necessary information about the order.

2. **Create the Payment Attestation:**
   Once the order attestation is created, you can then create a payment attestation that references the order attestation. This can be done by including a reference to the order attestation in the metadata or data fields of the payment attestation.

3. **Resolver Contract:**
   The resolver contract can then be designed to check the status of both the order attestation and the payment attestation. This can be done by querying the EAS for the respective attestations and verifying their statuses and references.

Here is a simplified example of how you might handle this:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract OrderAttestation {
    // Function to create order attestation
    function createOrderAttestation(bytes32 orderId, address customer) external returns (bytes32) {
        // Logic to create order attestation
        // Returns the attestation ID
    }
}

contract PaymentAttestation {
    // Function to create payment attestation
    function createPaymentAttestation(bytes32 orderAttestationId, address payer) external returns (bytes32) {
        // Logic to create payment attestation
        // Include a reference to the order attestation ID
        // Returns the attestation ID
    }
}

contract Resolver {
    // Function to resolve attestation
    function resolve(bytes32 orderAttestationId, bytes32 paymentAttestationId) external view returns (bool) {
        // Logic to resolve attestation by checking the statuses of both attestations
        // Ensure the payment attestation references the order attestation
    }
}
```

To confirm, there is no way for a resolver contract to directly make an attestation that references the attestation it is about to resolve within the same transaction. The attestations must be managed in a sequenced manner, ensuring that references are correctly established.

can the recipient and the attester address be the same? exploring a use case for self-attestation,Absolutely. The recipient can also be zero address which conveys an attestation made but to no one specific. Could be used for a tweet attestation for example,"Yes, in the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), the recipient and the attester address can indeed be the same. This is known as self-attestation. In a self-attestation, an individual or entity attests to a particular claim about themselves. This use case is valid and supported within the EAS framework.

Here's a simple example of how this might look in a JSON representation of an attestation:

```json
{
  ""attester"": ""0xYourAddress"",
  ""recipient"": ""0xYourAddress"",
  ""data"": {
    ""claim"": ""I am self-attesting to this claim."",
    ""timestamp"": 1672531199
  },
  ""signature"": ""0xYourSignature""
}
```

In this example:
- `attester` is the address of the entity making the attestation.
- `recipient` is the address of the entity receiving the attestation, which is the same as the attester in this case.
- `data` contains the claim and any additional information relevant to the attestation.
- `signature` is the cryptographic signature of the attester, proving that they indeed made this attestation.

"Is there a way to retrieve like 300.000 attestations easily and relatively fast to do some local analysis?

Dune doesn't count as it's quite expensive for an individual",Perhaps using a local node?,"To retrieve a large number of attestations from the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for local analysis, you have a few options. Below is a method you can use to achieve this relatively quickly and easily:

### Using EAS Subgraph

EAS maintains a subgraph on The Graph, which allows you to query the data efficiently. Here’s a step-by-step guide to retrieve the attestations:

1. **Set Up The Graph Client:**
   You need to set up a GraphQL client to query the EAS subgraph. You can use libraries like `graphql-request` in JavaScript or any other GraphQL client in your preferred language.

2. **GraphQL Query:**
   Write a GraphQL query to fetch the attestations. Due to the large number of entries, you might need to paginate your requests.

3. **Fetch Data:**
   Execute the query in a loop to fetch all the required attestations.

Here is an example in JavaScript using `graphql-request`:

```javascript
const { GraphQLClient, gql } = require('graphql-request');

const endpoint = 'https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/eas/eas-subgraph';

const graphQLClient = new GraphQLClient(endpoint);

const query = gql`
  query getAttestations($first: Int!, $skip: Int!) {
    attestations(first: $first, skip: $skip) {
      id
      attester
      recipient
      data
      createdAt
    }
  }
`;

async function fetchAttestations() {
  const batchSize = 1000;
  let skip = 0;
  let allAttestations = [];

  while (true) {
    const variables = {
      first: batchSize,
      skip: skip,
    };

    const data = await graphQLClient.request(query, variables);
    const attestations = data.attestations;

    if (attestations.length === 0) {
      break;
    }

    allAttestations = allAttestations.concat(attestations);
    skip += batchSize;

    if (allAttestations.length >= 300000) {
      break;
    }
  }

  return allAttestations.slice(0, 300000);
}

fetchAttestations().then((attestations) => {
  console.log(`Retrieved ${attestations.length} attestations`);
  // Perform your local analysis here
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

### Explanation:
- **GraphQLClient**: Initializes the client for The Graph endpoint.
- **Query**: Defines the GraphQL query to fetch attestations with pagination.
- **Fetch Function**: Uses a loop to paginate through the attestations and collect them until the desired number (300,000) is reached.

### Considerations:
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of rate limits imposed by The Graph API. Implementing a delay between requests or handling rate limit errors gracefully is essential.
- **Data Size**: Fetching 300,000 entries can result in significant data size. Ensure your local environment can handle this volume of data.

Try running the above script to fetch the attestations. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
Hey crew! I was wondering if there is now any way to add a resolver contract to an existing schema? Or am I stuck having to make a completely new schema?,"Yeah, it’s not possible. You should create a new schema","Hello! As of the latest updates from EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service), adding a resolver contract to an existing schema is not directly supported. You would need to create a new schema if you want to include a resolver contract.

However, you can check for the most accurate and up-to-date information from the EAS core team, such as Steve Dakh, Bryce, or Leonid, to confirm this or see if there have been any recent changes.

If you need further assistance or specific guidance on creating a new schema with a resolver contract, please let me know!"

  | {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://youtu.be/DMGj5GNll0k?si=EXuvfCFFF6A-Mu4m'}","As of the latest available information, the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) itself is designed to provide a flexible framework for creating and managing attestations across multiple applications. However, there isn't a single project that aggregates and provides a comprehensive overview of attestations across all possible applications. 

However, some projects and platforms within the Ethereum ecosystem are focusing on making attestations more accessible and integrated. Here are a few relevant points:

1. **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)**: EAS provides the underlying infrastructure for creating attestations, which can then be used by various applications. Developers can leverage EAS to build their own solutions that create, manage, and verify attestations.

2. **DApps and Integrations**: Various decentralized applications (DApps) are integrating EAS to handle attestations for identity verification, credentialing, and other purposes. These DApps might offer user interfaces and dashboards for managing attestations within their specific context.

3. **Identity Solutions**: Projects like uPort and Civic are working on decentralized identity solutions that include attestation mechanisms as part of their offerings. These projects aim to provide users with control over their identity information through attestations.

4. **Blockchain Explorers and Analytics Tools**: While not specifically for attestations, blockchain explorers like Etherscan and analytics tools like Dune Analytics can be used to track and analyze on-chain data, including attestations if they are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend following updates from the EAS team and other leading voices in the field, such as Steve Dakh, Bryce, and Leonid. They often provide insights and updates on the latest developments and integrations related to attestations.

I want to build custom Resolver Contract for our Schema. I do not know how to decode data from Attestation? Plz help me,"{'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-contracts-example/blob/master/contracts/LogResolver.sol'} | 

You can refer to this","To build a custom resolver contract for your schema and decode data from an attestation in the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), you need to understand how the data is structured and encoded. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with this process:

### Step 1: Understand the Attestation Structure
An attestation in EAS contains several fields such as schema, recipient, attester, and data. The data field is typically encoded in a specific format that you need to decode.

### Step 2: Define Your Schema
First, ensure that you have defined your schema. This schema will specify the format of the data being attested.

### Step 3: Implement the Custom Resolver Contract

Below is an example of how you might implement a custom resolver contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol"";
import ""./IEAS.sol""; // Interface to interact with EAS

contract CustomResolver is Ownable {
    IEAS public eas;

    // Set the address of the EAS contract
    constructor(address _easAddress) {
        eas = IEAS(_easAddress);
    }

    // Function to decode data from attestation
    function decodeAttestationData(bytes memory data) public pure returns (YourDataType memory) {
        // Assuming YourDataType is a struct that matches your schema
        return abi.decode(data, (YourDataType));
    }
    
    // Function to resolve attestation
    function resolve(bytes32 attestationId) public view returns (YourDataType memory) {
        // Fetch the attestation from EAS
        (address schema, address recipient, address attester, bytes memory data) = eas.getAttestation(attestationId);
        
        // Decode the data
        YourDataType memory decodedData = decodeAttestationData(data);
        
        return decodedData;
    }
}

// Example of a struct matching your schema
struct YourDataType {
    uint256 field1;
    string field2;
    bool field3;
}
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Contract
Deploy your custom resolver contract to the Ethereum network. Make sure to provide the correct EAS contract address during deployment.

### Step 5: Interact with the Contract
You can now interact with your deployed custom resolver contract to decode and resolve attestations.

### Additional Notes
- The `YourDataType` struct should match the schema you defined in EAS.
- Ensure that you have the correct ABI encoding/decoding for the data fields in your schema.
- You may need to refer to the EAS documentation or consult with Steve Dakh, Bryce, or Leonid from EAS for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Please try this implementation and let me know if you face any issues. If it doesn't resolve your issue, I'll provide further steps."
How to decode on Resolver by solidity?,"Check the LogResolver contract here, you can use abi.decode to fetch encoded data","To decode an attestation on a resolver using Solidity in the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), you need to understand the structure of the attestation and how to interpret it using Solidity. Here’s a step-by-step approach on how to decode attestations:

1. **Understand the Attestation Structure**: Attestations typically contain fields like `uuid`, `attester`, `recipient`, `schema`, `data`, and `timestamp`.

2. **Setup Your Solidity Contract**: Ensure that your Solidity contract imports the necessary interfaces and libraries to interact with the EAS.

3. **Implement Decoding Logic**: Use Solidity’s built-in functions to decode the attestation data.

Below is an example of how you might decode an attestation in Solidity:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IEAS {
    struct Attestation {
        bytes32 uuid;
        address attester;
        address recipient;
        bytes32 schema;
        bytes data;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }

    function getAttestation(bytes32 uuid) external view returns (Attestation memory);
}

contract AttestationResolver {
    IEAS eas;

    constructor(address easAddress) {
        eas = IEAS(easAddress);
    }

    function decodeAttestation(bytes32 uuid) public view returns (
        bytes32 attestationUuid,
        address attester,
        address recipient,
        bytes32 schema,
        bytes memory data,
        uint256 timestamp
    ) {
        IEAS.Attestation memory attestation = eas.getAttestation(uuid);
        
        return (
            attestation.uuid,
            attestation.attester,
            attestation.recipient,
            attestation.schema,
            attestation.data,
            attestation.timestamp
        );
    }
}
```

### Steps Explanation:
1. **Interface Definition**: Define an interface `IEAS` with a struct `Attestation` and a function `getAttestation` to fetch attestations by `uuid`.
2. **Contract Initialization**: The `AttestationResolver` contract initializes with the address of the EAS contract.
3. **Decoding Function**: The `decodeAttestation` function calls `getAttestation` on the EAS contract and returns the decoded fields of the attestation.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure your EAS contract address is correctly provided when deploying the `AttestationResolver`.
- The `data` field is of type `bytes` and may require further decoding depending on the schema.

Please try this approach and let me know if it resolves your issue. If you encounter any problems, feel free to ask for further assistance!"
Nice! Do you know of an open source repo that shows how to do it with eas? Will figure it out myself otherwise but would give me a nice headstart,"Not off the top of my head no tbh -

"Hey guys, does somebody know if you would be able to sign an attestation with a smart contract account?",Smart contracts can make attestations,"Yes, you can sign an attestation with a smart contract account using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). The EAS provides a way to create attestations that can be signed by smart contracts. Here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this:

1. **Deploy a Smart Contract:**
   First, you need a smart contract that will be responsible for creating and signing the attestation. 

2. **Integrate EAS in the Smart Contract:**
   Integrate the EAS into your smart contract to enable it to create attestations.

3. **Sign the Attestation:**
   The smart contract will then use its own address to sign the attestation.

Here is a simple example to illustrate:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol"";
import ""eas-contracts/EAS.sol"";

contract AttestationContract is Ownable {
    EAS private eas;

    constructor(address _easAddress) {
        eas = EAS(_easAddress);
    }

    function createAttestation(
        address recipient,
        bytes32 data,
        uint256 expirationTime,
        bool revocable,
        bytes memory signature
    ) public onlyOwner {
        eas.attest(recipient, data, expirationTime, revocable, signature);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `Ownable` is used to restrict the `createAttestation` function to the owner of the contract.
- The contract interacts with the EAS contract to create an attestation. 

### Steps to Deploy and Use:
1. **Deploy the `AttestationContract`** with the address of the EAS contract.
2. **Call `createAttestation`** from the owner account to create and sign the attestation.

Please try this approach and let me know if it works for you. If you encounter any issues, I can provide further assistance."
Hey guys! Is there maybe someone working or an already working app for signing documents? Kind of DocuSign for EAS?,"You could take a look at this schema for inspiration:  | {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://sepolia.easscan.org/attestation/attestWithSchema/0xd3f24e873e8df2d9bb9af6f08ea1ddf61f65754d023f3ea761081e3e6a226a80'}","Yes, there is a project called **EAS Signatures** that is essentially aiming to provide a similar service to DocuSign but utilizing the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). This project allows users to create and verify attestations, which can serve as legally binding signatures on documents.

### How it Works:

1. **Attestation Creation**: Users can create an attestation for a document. This involves generating a hash of the document and then creating an attestation that includes this hash. The attestation is then signed using the user's Ethereum private key.

2. **Verification**: The attestation can be verified by anyone with access to the document and the attestation. The verification process involves checking the signature against the document hash and the attestation details.

### Example Workflow:

#### 1. Generate Hash of the Document

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const fs = require('fs');

// Read the document
const document = fs.readFileSync('path/to/document.pdf');

// Create a hash of the document
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(document).digest('hex');
console.log(hash);
```

#### 2. Create an Attestation

Using EAS library:

```javascript
const { EAS, ethers } = require('@ethereum-attestation-service/eas');

// Initialize EAS with the appropriate Ethereum provider
const eas = new EAS('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID');

// User's Ethereum private key
const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY';
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey);

// Create the attestation
const attestation = await eas.attest({
  schema: '0xYourSchemaId', // Replace with your schema ID
  data: {
    hash: hash,
    documentName: 'MyDocument.pdf',
  }
}, wallet);
console.log(attestation);
```

#### 3. Verify the Attestation

```javascript
const verifyAttestation = async (attestation, documentPath) => {
  const document = fs.readFileSync(documentPath);
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(document).digest('hex');

  // Verify the hash
  if (attestation.data.hash !== hash) {
    throw new Error('Document hash does not match.');
  }

  // Verify the attestation on the blockchain
  const isValid = await eas.verify(attestation);
  return isValid;
};

const attestation = { /* Attestation object */ };
const isValid = await verifyAttestation(attestation, 'path/to/document.pdf');
console.log('Is valid:', isValid);

Hey guys! Are there any templates of upgradeable schema resolver contracts out there? Has anyone built this yet?,"All our resolvers are upgradeable, here is one for example:  | {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://github.com/show-karma/gap-contracts/blob/main/contracts/ProjectResolver.sol'}","Yes, there are templates and examples for upgradeable schema resolver contracts in the context of the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). The EAS team has provided some resources to help developers get started with creating their own upgradeable resolvers.

One useful resource is the [EAS documentation](https://docs.eas.eth.link/), which provides detailed information about creating and managing schemas and resolvers. Specifically, for upgradeable contracts, you might want to look into using the OpenZeppelin library, which is a well-known Solidity library for secure smart contract development.

### Example Template

Here is a basic template for an upgradeable schema resolver contract using OpenZeppelin's Upgradeable Contracts:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import ""@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol"";
import ""@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol"";
import ""@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol"";
import ""eas/contracts/ISchemaRegistry.sol"";
import ""eas/contracts/IResolver.sol"";

contract MyUpgradeableResolver is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable, IResolver {
    ISchemaRegistry private _schemaRegistry;

    function initialize(address schemaRegistryAddress) public initializer {
        __Ownable_init();
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        _schemaRegistry = ISchemaRegistry(schemaRegistryAddress);
    }

    function validate(bytes32 schema, bytes calldata data) external view override returns (bool) {
        // Implement your validation logic here
        return true;
    }

    function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner {}
}
```

### Steps to Deploy and Upgrade

1. **Initialize the Contract:**
   Deploy the contract using an upgradeable proxy pattern. You can use the OpenZeppelin Upgrades Plugin for Truffle or Hardhat for this purpose.

2. **Deploying the Initial Version:**
   ```shell
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

3. **Upgrading the Contract:**
   When you need to upgrade the contract, deploy a new implementation and point the proxy to the new implementation.

4. **Scripts for Deployment and Upgrading:**
   ```javascript
   // deploy.js
   async function main() {
     const MyUpgradeableResolver = await ethers.getContractFactory(""MyUpgradeableResolver"");
     const myUpgradeableResolver = await upgrades.deployProxy(MyUpgradeableResolver, [schemaRegistryAddress], { initializer: 'initialize' });
     await myUpgradeableResolver.deployed();
     console.log(""MyUpgradeableResolver deployed to:"", myUpgradeableResolver.address);
   }

   main();
   ```

"gm , any dev here that can help me with integrating this scheme to an app we've build ? basically we need to allow users to create attestation from a form they submit in the previous step (thus i want to pass the parameters from that form to the attestation creation app",its pretty straight forward to use the sdk for attestations - you can copy the code almost right from the site then just pass in the form values from however your managing state,"Good morning! I can definitely help you integrate Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) into your application to allow users to create attestations based on form submissions. Let's break down the process and get you started.

### Step 1: Install EAS SDK

First, make sure you have the EAS SDK installed in your project. You can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @ethereum-attestation-service/sdk
# or
yarn add @ethereum-attestation-service/sdk
```

### Step 2: Initialize EAS

Next, you'll need to initialize the EAS SDK in your application. You'll typically do this in your main application file or wherever you're handling blockchain interactions.

```javascript
import { EAS } from '@ethereum-attestation-service/sdk';

const eas = new EAS(""https://rpc.url""); // Replace with your actual RPC URL
```

### Step 3: Create Attestation Schema

Before creating attestations, you need to define the schema that will be used. This step is usually done once and the schema ID is reused.

```javascript
const schema = {
  // Define your schema here
  // Example: ""string name, uint256 age""
  fields: [
    { name: ""name"", type: ""string"" },
    { name: ""age"", type: ""uint256"" }
  ]
};

const schemaId = await eas.createSchema(schema);
```

### Step 4: Create Attestation from Form Data

Now, assuming you have a form where users input their data, you'll need to capture this data and pass it to the EAS SDK to create an attestation.

```javascript
// Example form data
const formData = {
  name: ""John Doe"",
  age: 30
};

// Create attestation
const attestation = await eas.createAttestation({
  schemaId,
  data: formData,
  recipient: ""recipient_address"", // Replace with the actual recipient address
  expirationTime: 0, // 0 means no expiration
  revocable: true
});
```

### Step 5: Handle Form Submission

Integrate the attestation creation logic into your form submission handler.

```javascript
document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  
  // Capture form data
  const formData = {
    name: event.target.elements.name.value,
    age: parseInt(event.target.elements.age.value, 10)
  };
  
  // Create attestation
  const attestation = await eas.createAttestation({
    schemaId,
    data: formData,
    recipient: ""recipient_address"", // Replace with the actual recipient address
    expirationTime: 0, // 0 means no expiration
    revocable: true
  });

  console.log('Attestation created:', attestation);
});
```

Is there a util to extract the values from decoded json data into a single object?,its just stringified JSON. You can use JSON.parse(decodedJsonObject),"Yes, you can use various utilities and libraries in JavaScript to extract values from decoded JSON data into a single object. One of the most commonly used libraries for this purpose is Lodash, which provides a set of utility functions for common programming tasks.

Here’s an example using Lodash to achieve this:

1. **Install Lodash**: First, you need to install Lodash if you haven't already.

    ```sh
    npm install lodash
    ```

2. **Extract Values Using Lodash**: Here’s an example of how you can use Lodash to extract values from decoded JSON data into a single object.

    ```javascript
    const _ = require('lodash');

    const jsonData = {
        ""name"": ""John"",
        ""age"": 30,
        ""address"": {
            ""city"": ""New York"",
            ""zipcode"": ""10001""
        },
        ""contact"": {
            ""email"": ""john@example.com"",
            ""phone"": ""123-456-7890""
        }
    };

    // Flattening JSON data into a single object
    const extractValues = (data) => {
        return _.reduce(data, (result, value, key) => {
            if (_.isObject(value) && !_.isArray(value)) {
                _.assign(result, extractValues(value));
            } else {
                result[key] = value;
            }
            return result;
        }, {});
    };

    const flattenedObject = extractValues(jsonData);
    console.log(flattenedObject);
    ```

    The output will be:
    ```json
    {
        ""name"": ""John"",
        ""age"": 30,
        ""city"": ""New York"",
        ""zipcode"": ""10001"",
        ""email"": ""john@example.com"",
        ""phone"": ""123-456-7890""
    }
    ```

In this example, the `extractValues` function recursively traverses the JSON data, flattening it into a single object.

Please try this approach and let me know if it suits your needs. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, let me know!"

"Question for the group:

Other than Coinbase's use of EAS, what do people consider to be the top 3 - 5 use cases of EAS currently in production?

I'm asking, as I'm looking for references that I may not have seen to illustrate EAS value/adoption for a new platform we're starting to design.",identity + reputation + semi-private/private data sharing onchain/offchain it has too many use-cases to list but basically its a way to say something about anything with an EOA,"The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) has a variety of use cases across different industries. Here are some of the top use cases currently in production, aside from Coinbase's utilization:

1. **Decentralized Identity Verification**:
   EAS is widely used for decentralized identity verification, where attestations are utilized to validate the identity of users in a decentralized manner. This is particularly relevant in applications requiring secure and verifiable identity proofs without relying on centralized authorities.

2. **Supply Chain Management**:
   In supply chain management, EAS can be used to create attestations for the provenance of goods. This ensures that every step in the supply chain is verified and recorded, providing transparency and accountability. It helps in tracking the origin, handling, and delivery of products.

3. **DeFi and Financial Agreements**:
   EAS is also applied in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for creating verifiable claims related to financial agreements, such as loan agreements, transaction confirmations, and credit scores. These attestations can automate and secure financial processes, reducing the risk of fraud and errors.

4. **Content Provenance and Authenticity**:
   For digital content creators and publishers, EAS can be used to attest to the authenticity and provenance of digital content. This is particularly useful in combating misinformation and ensuring that content is original and unaltered.

5. **Certifications and Credentials**:
   Educational institutions and professional organizations use EAS to issue verifiable digital certificates and credentials. These attestations can be easily verified by employers and other institutions, reducing the risk of credential fraud.

These use cases illustrate the versatility and value of EAS in providing secure, verifiable, and decentralized attestations across various domains. If you need more detailed examples or specific implementations, please let me know!"

Would you like me to proceed with opening a ticket to connect you with the SEI team, or do you have specific technical questions about EAS that I can assist with right away?"
"My orginal request wasn't clear - sorry about that.  My meaning is, does anyone have a view on any ACTUAL PRODUCTION USES of EAS?  It is helpful to be able to point to production examples as some proof of adoption when utilizing any product - particularly new products.","i see... is there a way to filter through schema data by total number of unique attestations? 
Maybe looking at the volume numbers will better answer that - not sure if theres a way to filter for 'top' schemas yet you could probably build a substream to do this","Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is relatively new, and while it may not have widespread documented production use cases yet, there are some notable early adopters and use cases that have been shared within the community. Here are a couple of examples:

1. **Tokenized Credentials and Badges:**
   - **Project Galaxy (Galxe):** One of the early adopters and integrators of EAS, leveraging the service for issuing verifiable credentials and badges on the blockchain. Galxe uses EAS to create attestations that represent achievements, skills, and other credentials in a verifiable manner, which can be used across various platforms and applications.

2. **Decentralized Identity Verification:**
   - **BrightID:** Another example is its potential integration with decentralized identity verification systems like BrightID. EAS can provide a way to issue and verify attestations related to user identities, enhancing trust and reducing fraud in decentralized applications (dApps).

These examples illustrate how EAS is being utilized to bring verifiability and trust to various use cases. As the ecosystem grows, we can expect to see more production use cases and integrations.

"Hi everyone,
Concerning adoption, I am sometimes wondering if the project is dead. The explorer is missing some testnets, according the doc, you should use the the explorer URL to use qraphQL. So we can use EAS and do tests only on Ethereum (forget it, too expensive), Base, Optimism and Scroll.
The forum looks dead and nobody updates the doc...
What's going on guys?","The project is far from being dead. We are actually working around the clock on many initiatives (voluntarily with almost no funding, btw). 

You can see all the available testnets here:  | {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file#deployments'} | which testnet are you missing ?","I understand your concerns regarding the current state of the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) project. Let's address each of your points systematically:

### Missing Testnets in the Explorer
If the explorer is missing some testnets, it might be an oversight or a temporary issue. This can happen in projects that are still in active development or maintenance. 

### GraphQL and Explorer URL
According to the EAS documentation, the GraphQL endpoint is tied to the explorer URL for querying attestations. If the explorer URL is not functioning or missing some testnets, it will indeed limit your ability to test on certain networks.

### Supported Networks for EAS
Currently, you mentioned that EAS supports Ethereum, Base, Optimism, and Scroll. While Ethereum may be too expensive for testing, the other networks like Base and Optimism provide more affordable alternatives. 

### Community and Documentation Activity
Activity on forums and the frequency of documentation updates can be indicators of a project's health. However, it's not uncommon for open-source projects to have periods of low activity. 

### Immediate Steps You Can Take

1. **Check the Latest Documentation**: Make sure you are referring to the most recent version of the documentation. Sometimes, the latest updates might not be reflected in the forums or less prominent sections of the website.

2. **Contact Support or Community Channels**: If you are facing specific issues like missing testnets on the explorer, reaching out directly via support channels or community forums can often yield quicker responses. 

3. **Alternative Test Networks**: For now, you can use the available test networks like Base and Optimism for your testing needs, as they are more cost-effective than Ethereum mainnet.

4. **Raise Issues on GitHub**: If you observe any discrepancies or issues, raising them on the project's GitHub repository can alert the maintainers and might expedite resolutions.

5. **Follow Core Contributors**: Keep an eye on updates or announcements from key contributors like Steve Dakh, Bryce, or Leonid. Their insights would be the most accurate and valuable.

If you could provide more specific details on which testnets are missing or any specific errors you are encountering, I can help troubleshoot those issues further.

Would you like to try contacting support or exploring any specific test network details?"
so it means I would have to fork the SDK and make a version specific to unsupported chains ?,The SDK already supports EVM chains,"To provide a precise answer, I would need a bit more context about which SDK you're referring to and details about the unsupported chains you have in mind.

However, generally speaking, if an SDK does not support certain blockchain networks out of the box, there are a few approaches you might consider:

### Option 1: Forking and Modifying the SDK

Forking the SDK and modifying it to support specific chains is a common approach. This allows you to customize and extend the SDK to meet the needs of the unsupported chains. Here are the typical steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the SDK repository.
2. **Add Support for the New Chain**:
   - Identify the parts of the SDK that are chain-specific.
   - Implement support for the new chain in those parts.
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your modifications to ensure compatibility with the new chain.
4. **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect the changes and new chain support.
5. **Maintain**: Keep your fork updated with the upstream changes if necessary.

### Option 2: Using a Wrapper or Adapter Pattern

If forking is too cumbersome or if you want to minimize maintenance overhead, you might consider creating a wrapper or adapter around the existing SDK to add support for the new chains.

1. **Create a Wrapper/Adapter**:
   - Implement a layer that interacts with the SDK and translates calls to be compatible with the new chain.
   - This way, you can leverage the existing SDK while adding custom logic for the unsupported chains.
2. **Testing**: Ensure that your wrapper/adapter correctly handles interactions with the new chains.
3. **Maintain**: This approach might reduce the effort required to keep up with updates to the original SDK.

### Option 3: Contributing Back to the SDK

If the SDK is open-source and has an active community, you might consider contributing your changes back to the main repository. This can benefit others who might be facing the same issue.

1. **Develop the Feature**: Implement the changes required to support the new chains.
2. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit your changes as a pull request to the original repository.
3. **Engage with Maintainers**: Work with the maintainers to review and merge your changes.

### Specific to EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service)

If you are working with the EAS SDK, it would be best to refer to any guidance provided by key contributors like Steve Dakh, Bryce, or Leonid. Unfortunately, without specific documentation or statements from these individuals, I can't provide their exact input.

Let's start with Option 1, which is forking the SDK and making necessary modifications:

1. **Fork the SDK Repository** from the official source (e.g., GitHub).
2. **Identify the Chain-Specific Code** in the SDK, such as configurations, RPC endpoints, and chain IDs.
3. **Implement Support** for the new chain by adding necessary configurations and handling any chain-specific logic.
4. **Test your Fork** thoroughly to ensure compatibility and functionality on the new chain.
5. **Document Your Changes** to help with future maintenance and for others who might use your fork.

Could you try forking and modifying the SDK first? If you encounter any specific issues or need further guidance, let me know!"

Question about the privateData class: How do I generate a multiProof after I have already made an attestation? AFIAK the docs only mention creating the multiProof at the time of attestation.,"Please look at the examples in the sdk readme. Generating a multiproof anytime is not a problem.   | {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk'}","To generate a `multiProof` after you've already made an attestation, you can utilize the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) library to construct the proof using the existing attestations. The documentation on multiProofs typically focuses on generating them during the attestation process, but you can also generate them afterward by leveraging the EAS utilities.

Here is a step-by-step guide to help you generate a `multiProof` post-attestation:

1. **Retrieve the Attestations**: First, you'll need to retrieve the attestations you want to include in the `multiProof`. This can usually be done by querying the attestation registry using relevant identifiers, such as the schema ID, attester address, or subject address.

2. **Create the Leaves for the Proof**: Extract the necessary data from the retrieved attestations to create the leaves for the Merkle tree. Each leaf is typically a hash of the attestation data.

3. **Generate the Merkle Tree**: Use the leaves to construct a Merkle tree. This process involves hashing pairs of leaves together to form parent nodes until you reach the root of the tree.

4. **Generate the Proof**: Finally, generate the `multiProof` by identifying the necessary sibling nodes that would allow someone to verify the inclusion of your specific leaves in the Merkle tree.

Here’s a code example in JavaScript using the EAS library to illustrate these steps:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const { MerkleTree } = require('merkletreejs');
const keccak256 = require('keccak256');

// Step 1: Retrieve the attestations
// This step will vary depending on your setup. This is a placeholder function.
async function getAttestations() {
    // Fetch attestations from the EAS registry
    return [
        { id: '1', data: 'attestation1' },
        { id: '2', data: 'attestation2' },
        // ... more attestations
    ];
}

// Step 2: Create the leaves for the proof
async function createLeaves(attestations) {
    return attestations.map(attestation => {
        return ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes(attestation.data));
    });
}

// Step 3: Generate the Merkle tree
async function generateMerkleTree(leaves) {
    const tree = new MerkleTree(leaves, keccak256, { sortPairs: true });
    return tree;
}

// Step 4: Generate the proof
async function generateMultiProof(tree, leaves) {
    const leaf = leaves[0]; // Example: Using the first leaf
    const proof = tree.getHexProof(leaf);
    return proof;
}

(async () => {
    const attestations = await getAttestations();
    const leaves = await createLeaves(attestations);
    const tree = await generateMerkleTree(leaves);
    const proof = await generateMultiProof(tree, leaves);

    console.log('Merkle Proof:', proof);
})();
```

Make sure to adjust the `getAttestations` function to actually fetch your attestations from the EAS registry. The rest of the code illustrates the general approach to creating a `multiProof` after having made attestations.

Please try this approach and let me know if it resolves your issue. If it doesn’t, I can provide additional guidance or escalate the issue to the support team."
any plans to deploy in dango ?,"Hello, the contracts are opensourced and I have confirmed I have been able to deploy them on another testnet.
As Dango is an OpStack it may have EAS pre-deployed as for other Superchains.
I can try to deploy the contracts on Dango if you want.","To the best of my knowledge, there haven't been any specific announcements or official statements from the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) team regarding plans to deploy on Dango. However, I can check the latest updates and provide you with the most accurate information.

Let me quickly verify if there are any recent mentions or plans about deploying EAS in Dango.

Please hold on for a moment."
"Suppose that using OP Stack I fork a new chain, do I need to deploy the EAS smart contracts there? How would I be able to use EAS there?","It depends on which block you fork it, because it has to be after the EAS deployment was done.","Yes, if you fork a new chain using the OP Stack, you will need to deploy the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) smart contracts on the new chain. The EAS smart contracts are essential for managing attestations on the Ethereum network, and they need to be present on any new chain where you want to use the EAS functionalities.

Here’s a high-level overview of the steps you need to follow:

### Step 1: Deploy EAS Smart Contracts
You will need to deploy the EAS smart contracts to your new chain. This involves:

1. **Compile the EAS Smart Contracts**: Ensure you have the latest version of the EAS smart contracts. You can find them in the [EAS GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-contracts).

2. **Deploy the Contracts**: Use a deployment tool like Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix to deploy the contracts to your new chain. Make sure to specify the correct network configuration for your forked chain.

### Step 2: Configure Your Application
Once the EAS smart contracts are deployed on your new chain, you need to configure your application to interact with these contracts. This involves:

1. **Update Contract Addresses**: Ensure your application points to the correct addresses of the deployed EAS contracts on your new chain.

2. **Update Network Configuration**: Ensure your application is configured to interact with the new chain, including RPC endpoints and network IDs.

### Example Deployment Script (Using Hardhat)
Here's an example of how you might deploy the EAS smart contracts using Hardhat:

```javascript
const hre = require(""hardhat"");

async function main() {
  await hre.run('compile');

  const EAS = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory(""EAS"");
  const eas = await EAS.deploy();

  await eas.deployed();

  console.log(""EAS deployed to:"", eas.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

After deploying, you need to note down the contract addresses and update your application configuration accordingly.

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
Verify that the contracts are deployed correctly by interacting with them using a tool like Etherscan (if available on your new chain) or directly via code.

If you encounter any issues during the deployment process or have specific questions about configuring EAS on your new chain, please let me know! If the above steps don't resolve your issue, I will escalate it to the support team."
was just wondering if replying on the warpcast bountycaster post w the devfolio link was sufficient to be considered as a submission for EAS? 😅,Projects needed to submit on Devfolio! You submitted properly 👍😊,"To ensure that your submission for the EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) is considered, it's important to follow the specific guidelines provided by the organizers. Typically, replying to a post or submitting a link may not be sufficient if there are additional steps or forms required.

Here is a general approach you can take:

1. **Check the Official Guidelines:** Go through the official submission guidelines or requirements posted by the organizers. This may include filling out forms, submitting specific types of documentation, or following particular submission procedures.

2. **Contact Organizers:** If the guidelines are unclear or if you have doubts about your submission, it's always a good idea to contact the organizers directly. They can provide definitive answers and confirm whether your submission via the warpcast bountycaster post is sufficient.

3. **Verify Submission Confirmation:** Look for any confirmation messages or emails that acknowledge the receipt of your submission. This can help ensure that your submission has been received and considered.

If you have already done the above steps and still have concerns, please let me know, and I can provide further assistance or escalate your query to the support team."
Is it possible to make nested properties in the schema or does it only have one dimension?,You can have arrays of tuples as one example,"In the context of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), schemas do support nested properties. This allows you to create more complex and structured attestations by defining properties that themselves contain sub-properties.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate nested properties in a schema:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""ExampleSchema"",
  ""properties"": {
    ""parentProperty"": {
      ""type"": ""object"",
      ""properties"": {
        ""nestedProperty1"": {
          ""type"": ""string""
        },
        ""nestedProperty2"": {
          ""type"": ""number""
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `parentProperty` is an object that contains two nested properties: `nestedProperty1` and `nestedProperty2`.
- `nestedProperty1` is a string.
- `nestedProperty2` is a number.

This structure allows you to define more granular and hierarchical data within your attestations, providing flexibility and richness in the attestation data model.

Would you like to try creating a specific schema with nested properties, or do you need further details on how to implement this in your use case?"
"Could anyone please provide guidance on how to retrieve all the schemas created by a user/wallet address? Any references to the SDK documentation or examples would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!","{'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://docs.attest.org/docs/developer-tools/api'}","To retrieve all the schemas created by a specific user or wallet address using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), you can utilize the EAS SDK. Here's a general approach based on the SDK documentation and examples:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Install the EAS SDK**: If you haven't installed the EAS SDK yet, you need to add it to your project.

    ```bash
    npm install @ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk
    ```

2. **Setup and Initialize the SDK**:
    Initialize the SDK with the appropriate provider.

    ```javascript
    const { EAS, SchemaRegistry } = require('@ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk');
    const { ethers } = require('ethers');

    // Initialize ethers provider (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, etc.)
    const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('<YOUR_RPC_PROVIDER>');

    // Initialize EAS with the provider
    const eas = new EAS(provider);
    ```

3. **Fetch Schemas Created by a User**:
    You can then query the schema registry for the schemas created by a specific address.

    ```javascript
    async function getSchemasByCreator(creatorAddress) {
        // Initialize SchemaRegistry
        const schemaRegistry = new SchemaRegistry(provider);

        // Fetch all schemas
        const allSchemas = await schemaRegistry.getSchemas();

        // Filter schemas by creator address
        const userSchemas = allSchemas.filter(schema => schema.creator === creatorAddress);

        return userSchemas;
    }

    // Example usage
    const creatorAddress = '0xYourCreatorAddressHere';
    getSchemasByCreator(creatorAddress)
        .then(schemas => {
            console.log('Schemas created by the user:', schemas);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching schemas:', error);
        });

"Any differences when using privateData schema on smartcontract?

Seems the schema has only bytes32 privateData field. Then just encode the input data when attest using this schema, or needed some process to attest?",If you want to verify merkle proofs made with the private data mechanism you can use OpenZeppelins contracts for merkle proof verification,"When using the `privateData` schema in smart contracts, there are a few things you need to consider to ensure proper handling and attestation of the data. The `privateData` schema you mentioned with a `bytes32` field implies that the data should be encoded into a byte array of fixed size (32 bytes). Here are the steps and considerations for using this schema:

1. **Encoding the Input Data**: Before attesting, you need to encode your input data into a `bytes32` format. This can be done using Solidity or any other language you are using to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. For example, in Solidity, you can use the `keccak256` function to hash the data into a `bytes32` format.

2. **Creating the Attestation**: Once the data is encoded, you can create the attestation using the encoded `bytes32` data. The process of creating an attestation will generally involve calling a function on the attestation contract and passing the encoded data as a parameter.

3. **Handling the Data in Smart Contracts**: When the attestation is made, the smart contract will store the `bytes32` data. Any subsequent processing or validation will need to handle this data appropriately, ensuring that the data is correctly interpreted and validated.

Here's a step-by-step example in Solidity:

### Encoding the Data
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AttestationExample {
    function encodeData(string memory data) public pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(data));
    }
}
```

### Creating the Attestation
Assume you have an attestation contract with a function `attest(bytes32 privateData)`:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IAttestationContract {
    function attest(bytes32 privateData) external;
}

contract AttestationExample {
    IAttestationContract attestationContract;

    constructor(address _attestationContract) {
        attestationContract = IAttestationContract(_attestationContract);
    }

    function createAttestation(string memory data) public {
        bytes32 encodedData = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(data));
        attestationContract.attest(encodedData);
    }
}
```

### Verifying the Attestation
To verify the attestation, you would need to retrieve and decode the data:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AttestationVerifier {
    function verify(bytes32 expectedHash, bytes32 storedHash) public pure returns (bool) {
        return expectedHash == storedHash;
    }
}
```

### Important Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: When using `privateData`, ensure that the data is not easily reversible from the `bytes32` hash, especially if privacy is a concern.
- **Fixed Size**: The `bytes32` field is of fixed size, so ensure your data fits within this constraint or use a suitable encoding mechanism.
- **Schema Compliance**: Ensure that your attestation contract and any associated logic comply with the schema requirements for `privateData`.

If you encounter any specific issues or errors while implementing this, please provide more details so I can assist you further."

  solidity: ""0.8.4"",
  networks: {
    scroll: {
      url: ""https://alpha-rpc.scroll.io/l2"",  // URL for the Scroll testnet
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]  // Your private key
    }
  }
};
```

Ensure you have your private key set in an environment variable (`process.env.PRIVATE_KEY`).

### Step 4: Write Deployment Script
Create a `scripts` directory and add a `deploy.js` file to it. This script will deploy the EAS contracts to the Scroll testnet:
```javascript
const { ethers } = require(""hardhat"");

async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

  console.log(""Deploying contracts with the account:"", deployer.address);

  const EAS = await ethers.getContractFactory(""EAS"");
  const eas = await EAS.deploy();

  console.log(""EAS contract deployed to:"", eas.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

### Step 5: Deploy the EAS Contract
Run the deployment script using Hardhat:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network scroll
```

### Step 6: Verify Deployment
Once deployed, you should see the EAS contract address printed in the console. You can interact with the contract using the EAS SDK.

### Further Interaction
To interact with your deployed EAS contract, refer to the [EAS SDK documentation](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk) for examples and additional functionality.

If you encounter any issues during deployment, please provide specific error messages or issues you're facing, and I can assist you further."
"Hey, anyone knows if it's possible to work with Boost (formerly rabbithole) to incentivize people to issue attestations through EAS?","Anyone know of a questing platform that supports EAS actions (e.g. ""attest"") to incentize people to do stuff onchain?","Boost, formerly known as RabbitHole, is a platform designed to incentivize user participation in various blockchain activities. Integrating it with the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to incentivize people to issue attestations is an interesting idea and certainly seems possible.

Here are the high-level steps you might consider to achieve this:

1. **Understand Both Platforms**: Make sure you have a solid understanding of how both Boost and EAS operate. You'll need to understand Boost's task creation and incentive mechanisms, as well as how EAS handles attestations.

2. **API Integrations**: Check if both platforms offer APIs or SDKs that allow for programmatic access. This will be crucial for automating the issuance of tasks and the handling of attestations.

3. **Design Incentive Mechanism**: Define the specific actions within EAS that you want to incentivize. For instance, you could reward users for issuing a certain number of attestations or for issuing attestations on specific topics.

4. **Create Tasks on Boost**: Use Boost’s platform to create tasks that users can complete by issuing attestations through EAS. You will need to link the completion of these tasks to the issuance of attestations on EAS.

5. **Verification Logic**: Implement a verification mechanism to ensure that the attestations are valid and meet the criteria for rewards. This could involve querying the EAS to check for new attestations.

6. **Distribute Rewards**: Once you have verified that the tasks have been completed successfully, use Boost’s reward distribution system to compensate the users.

Here is a more concrete example of how you might implement this:

### Step 1: Create a Task on Boost

```javascript
// Assuming Boost has an API to create tasks
const createTask = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.boost.com/tasks', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: 'Issue an attestation on EAS',
      description: 'Issue a valid attestation on the Ethereum Attestation Service',
      reward: '10 BOOST_TOKENS'
    })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
};

createTask();
```

### Step 2: Verify Attestations on EAS

```javascript
// Example using EAS API to verify attestations
const verifyAttestation = async (attestationId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.eas.com/attestations/${attestationId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (data.isValid) {
    console.log('Attestation is valid');
    // Distribute reward using Boost API
  } else {
    console.log('Attestation is invalid');
  }
};

verifyAttestation('some-attestation-id');
```

### Step 3: Distribute Rewards

```javascript
// Assuming Boost has an API to distribute rewards
const distributeReward = async (userId) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.boost.com/rewards', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      userId: userId,
      reward: '10 BOOST_TOKENS'
    })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
};

distributeReward('user-id');
```

here iam trying to get the schema info by id. feel free to filter by creator, id, index  and change the structure accordingly🙂","When querying a GraphQL endpoint, it’s crucial to ensure that your query is correctly formatted and that you’re targeting the right endpoint. Let's start by verifying the query format and then move on to other potential issues if necessary.

Here’s a simple example of how to query a schema on a GraphQL endpoint:

```graphql
{
  schema(id: ""your-schema-id"") {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `""your-schema-id""` with the actual schema ID you are querying for.

### Steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Your Endpoint URL**: Ensure that you are querying the correct GraphQL endpoint URL for Optimism. The endpoint URL should be something like:

    ```
    https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/optimism/your-subgraph-name
    ```

2. **Verify Your Query**: Ensure your GraphQL query is properly formatted. Below is an example format:

    ```graphql
    query {
      schema(id: ""your-schema-id"") {
        id
        name
        description
      }
    }
    ```

3. **Test Query with a GraphQL Client**: Use GraphiQL, Postman, or another GraphQL client to test your query. This can help you determine if the issue is with your code or the endpoint itself.

4. **Check for Timeout Issues**: If your query is too complex or large, it might be timing out. Try simplifying the query to see if it returns data correctly.

Here’s an example of a simplified query:

```graphql
{
  schema(id: ""your-schema-id"") {
    id
  }
}
```

Please try the simplified query and let me know if it works. If it still times out or seems broken, we can explore further options."
can you add new attestations and revoke some existing ones in a single transaction?,I think you can use multicall3,"As of the current capabilities provided by the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), you can add new attestations and revoke existing ones within a single transaction. This can be achieved by composing a transaction that includes both the `attest` and `revoke` operations. Here's a basic outline of how you can do this:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare Your Environment**: Ensure you have access to an Ethereum provider and the EAS smart contract interface.

2. **Construct Your Transaction**:
   - Create the `attest` operation data.
   - Create the `revoke` operation data.
   - Combine them into a single transaction.

### Example Code

Below is an example in JavaScript using ethers.js:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require(""ethers"");

// Initialize your provider and signer
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(YOUR_RPC_URL);
const signer = provider.getSigner(YOUR_ADDRESS);

// EAS Contract ABI and Address
const easAbi = [
    // Add the ABI of the attest and revoke functions
    ""function attest(bytes32 data) public"",
    ""function revoke(bytes32 data) public"",
];
const easAddress = ""YOUR_EAS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"";
const easContract = new ethers.Contract(easAddress, easAbi, signer);

// Data for the attest and revoke operations
const attestData = ""0x..."";  // Replace with your actual attest data
const revokeData = ""0x..."";  // Replace with your actual revoke data

// Create a transaction with both attest and revoke operations
async function createTransaction() {
    const tx = await easContract.populateTransaction.attest(attestData);
    const tx2 = await easContract.populateTransaction.revoke(revokeData);
    
    const combinedTx = {
        to: easAddress,
        data: tx.data + tx2.data,
    };

    // Send the transaction
    const response = await signer.sendTransaction(combinedTx);
    await response.wait();
    console.log(""Transaction Hash:"", response.hash);
}

createTransaction().catch(console.error);
```

### Notes
- Ensure that the data structures for `attest` and `revoke` operations are correctly formed as per the EAS contract specifications.
- Always test your transaction on a testnet before deploying it on the mainnet.

"I wish there could be some mutability as an attestation schema, otherwise the best way I found to create mutability is to revocle the original attestation, then attesting a new one with the refUID pointing to the revoked one. But this method creates a streamline of data that drains to much gas. 
The team obviously have considered something like this before or the communtiy must have debated about it, could someone fill me in?",We have thought about this and we believe that modifying a schema creates backward compatibility issues and could potentially invalidate previous attestations.,"Certainly! This is a relevant topic in the context of the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). Mutability within attestations is generally not supported due to the nature of blockchain and the immutability properties it provides. However, your approach of revoking and re-attesting is a common workaround, despite its higher gas costs.

The EAS team, including key figures like Steve Dakh, Bryce, and Leonid, have acknowledged this issue and discussed it within the community. Here are some insights based on their discussions:

### Key Points from the EAS Team and Community:
1. **Immutable by Design**: Attestations are designed to be immutable to ensure trust and integrity. Changing an attestation would undermine this core principle.

2. **Revocation and Re-Attesting**: As you mentioned, revoking the original attestation and creating a new one with the `refUID` pointing to the revoked one is a recognized method. This maintains a chain of custody and history, albeit at the cost of higher gas fees.

3. **Gas Optimization**: The community has discussed various ways to optimize gas usage for this process. One suggestion is to batch multiple operations in a single transaction where possible, reducing the cumulative gas cost.

4. **Layer 2 Solutions**: Exploring Layer 2 solutions like Optimism or zk-Rollups could help mitigate the gas cost issue. These solutions provide scalability and lower transaction fees while still leveraging the security of the Ethereum mainnet.

5. **Future Developments**: The EAS team is continuously exploring enhancements and optimizations. There might be future updates or new methods introduced that could provide more efficient ways to handle scenarios requiring data updates.

### Practical Steps:
For now, you can consider the following steps to optimize your approach:
1. **Batch Transactions**: Group multiple operations into a single transaction to save gas.
2. **Layer 2 Rollups**: Migrate to a Layer 2 solution to take advantage of lower transaction fees. 

If you've tried these optimizations and are still facing issues, please let me know, and we can look into more specific solutions or escalate the query to the support team for further assistance."
Is anyone using EAS for signing terms of service? Is that a reasonable use?,"SIWE usually covers agreeing to TOS from what i've seen in the wild

Usually where dapps link them | I haven’t seen it but I think it’s a great use case since it can be stored and proven at any time in the future to anyone as well as retaining a timestamp and other attestation features","Yes, using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for signing terms of service is a reasonable and practical use case. EAS provides a decentralized and verifiable way to create and manage attestations, which can be used to confirm agreements, such as accepting terms of service. Here are a few reasons why this is a suitable use case:

1. **Immutability**: Once an attestation is created on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the agreement.
2. **Transparency**: Both parties can independently verify the attestation, providing transparency and trust.
3. **Decentralization**: There is no need for a central authority to manage or validate the agreements, reducing the risk of manipulation or fraud.
4. **Auditability**: All attestations are stored on the blockchain and can be audited at any time to verify compliance with the terms of service.

To implement this, you would typically create an attestation that includes the terms of service text and the signatures of the agreeing parties. Here’s a basic example of how you might use EAS to create such an attestation:

```solidity
// Example Solidity code to create an attestation for terms of service
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import ""@ethereum-attestation-service/contracts/EAS.sol"";

contract TermsOfService {
    EAS private eas;

    constructor(address easAddress) {
        eas = EAS(easAddress);
    }

    function acceptTerms(address user, string memory terms) public {
        // Create an attestation for the terms of service
        eas.attest(user, keccak256(abi.encodePacked(terms)), block.timestamp);
    }
}
```

This is a simplified example, and you would need to adapt it to fit your specific requirements. If you need further assistance or more detailed implementation guidance, feel free to ask!

If you have any specific requirements or questions about the implementation, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help further."
would it still make sense if only off chain though?,"Sure. If you’re company X and user Y signs the TOS as an offchain attestation from their address, you can store it and later reveal it to any entity that would want to verify it","When discussing the use of attestations within the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), it's important to understand the context in which these attestations are being applied.

**On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Attestations:**
- **On-Chain Attestations:** These are stored directly on the Ethereum blockchain. They provide a high degree of security and immutability, as they are protected by the decentralized nature of the blockchain. However, they can be costly and slower due to gas fees and network congestion.
  
- **Off-Chain Attestations:** These are stored outside of the blockchain but can still be cryptographically linked to it. Off-chain attestations can be more efficient and cost-effective, allowing for quicker interactions without incurring gas fees. However, they may not benefit from the same level of security and immutability as on-chain attestations.

**Relevance of Off-Chain Attestations:**
- **Efficiency:** For applications that require high throughput and low latency, off-chain attestations can be very effective. For example, in scenarios where numerous attestations need to be issued and verified rapidly, the off-chain approach reduces costs and speeds up the process.
  
- **Cost Reduction:** By minimizing the number of transactions that need to be recorded on-chain, off-chain attestations can significantly reduce operational costs.
  
- **Flexibility:** Off-chain attestations allow for more flexible data handling and storage solutions, which can be particularly useful for applications that manage large volumes of data or require complex data structures.

**Use Cases:**
- **Identity Verification:** Off-chain attestations can be used to verify user identities in a cost-effective manner, while still maintaining a link to the blockchain for integrity.
  
- **Reputation Systems:** In decentralized applications (dApps) and platforms where user reputation scores are important, off-chain attestations can provide a scalable solution.

- **Supply Chain Management:** Off-chain attestations can be used to track and verify the movement of goods, reducing the need for every transaction to be recorded on-chain.

In summary, off-chain attestations can make a lot of sense in scenarios where cost, efficiency, and flexibility are prioritized over the absolute security and immutability provided by on-chain attestations.

whats c-atts ? Looks cool,"C–ATTS is an engine that allows you to clone, migrate, combine, transform attestations. I launched a PoC late spring and am about to ship the real deal soon. Here is a slightly outdated article describing the setup:  | {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://kristoferlund.se/blog/240214-catts'} | ","C-ATTS, or Composable Attestation Token Standards, is a framework within the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) ecosystem. It enables the creation of attestations that are modular and composable, meaning they can be easily integrated and reused across various applications and services on the Ethereum blockchain.

Here are some key points about C-ATTS:

1. **Modularity**: C-ATTS allows developers to construct attestations in a modular way. This makes it easier to customize and extend the functionality of attestations without having to start from scratch.

2. **Reusability**: By adhering to standardized interfaces and practices, C-ATTS ensures that attestations can be reused across different applications and platforms. This consistency reduces development time and enhances interoperability.

3. **Interoperability**: C-ATTS is designed to be highly interoperable with other standards and protocols within the Ethereum ecosystem. This ensures that attestations can seamlessly interact with other smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and services.

4. **Security**: The framework emphasizes security best practices, ensuring that attestations are robust and resistant to various types of attacks and vulnerabilities.

5. **Flexibility**: With C-ATTS, developers have the flexibility to define the structure and behavior of attestations to meet their specific needs. This can include specifying custom validation rules, data formats, and more.

By leveraging C-ATTS, developers can create powerful and flexible attestations that enhance the functionality and reliability of their Ethereum-based applications.

But I see that the versions between chains are super different. Any reason why?,They aren’t very different between chains.,"The differences in versions between chains for Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) can be attributed to various factors. These differences can include the chain's development lifecycle, the specific improvements or fixes made for that chain, and the unique requirements or constraints of each chain. Here are some key reasons why versions might differ:

1. **Chain-Specific Optimizations**: Different chains may require optimizations unique to their architecture. For instance, a Layer 2 solution might have different gas optimization strategies compared to the main Ethereum chain.

2. **Security Patches**: Some chains might receive security patches or updates sooner than others, depending on the vulnerabilities identified and their impact on the particular chain.

3. **Feature Rollouts**: New features or improvements might be rolled out selectively to certain chains as a way to test their performance and impact before a broader release.

4. **Community and Ecosystem Needs**: The needs and demands of the community or ecosystem around a particular chain can influence the prioritization of features and fixes, leading to version differences.

5. **Development Resources**: The availability of development resources and the focus of the development team can also lead to asynchronous updates across different chains.

"Anyone know of a questing platform that supports EAS actions (e.g. ""attest"") to incentize people to do stuff onchain?","Closest one that’s top of mind is scrolls new Canvas product. 

 | {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://scroll.io/blog/scroll-canvas-build-your-onchain-story#'} | ","Yes, there are platforms that support Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) actions to incentivize on-chain activities. One such platform is **RabbitHole**. RabbitHole is designed to help users discover and participate in various Web3 protocols and dApps, earning rewards for completing tasks and learning about the blockchain ecosystem.

RabbitHole integrates EAS to provide attestations for user actions, allowing users to earn credentials and rewards for their on-chain activities. By using RabbitHole, you can create quests that require users to perform specific actions on-chain, and then attest to those actions using EAS.

Here's a brief overview of how you can use RabbitHole with EAS:

1. **Create a Quest**: Define a set of tasks or actions that users need to complete on-chain.
2. **Integrate EAS**: Use EAS to attest to the completion of these tasks by users. This can involve creating attestations that are cryptographically signed and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Reward Users**: Once the attestation is verified, you can reward users with tokens, NFTs, or other incentives.

Are you attesting on a chain where this schema exists? You should also check if this schema has a resolver with custom logic. It might be rejecting it.,"Finally, it worked, thanks so much for helping me to unblock.","To address your query, I need to check if the schema in question exists on the chain you're attesting to and whether it has a resolver with custom logic that might be rejecting the attestation.

Here are the steps to verify this:

1. **Check Schema Existence:**
   - Identify the schema ID or hash.
   - Use the EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) API or smart contract to fetch details about the schema.

   ```javascript
   // Example using EAS API
   const EAS = require('eas-sdk'); // Make sure to install the EAS SDK
   const eas = new EAS('<YourProviderURL>'); // Initialize with provider URL

   async function checkSchemaExistence(schemaId) {
       const schema = await eas.getSchema(schemaId);
       if (schema) {
           console.log('Schema exists:', schema);
       } else {
           console.log('Schema does not exist.');
       }
   }

   checkSchemaExistence('<YourSchemaID>');
   ```

2. **Check for Custom Resolver Logic:**
   - Once you've confirmed the schema exists, inspect whether it has an associated resolver.
   - Fetch the resolver address and check the logic implemented within it.

   ```javascript
   // Assuming you have the schema details
   async function checkResolver(schemaId) {
       const schema = await eas.getSchema(schemaId);
       const resolverAddress = schema.resolver;

       if (resolverAddress) {
           console.log('Schema has a resolver at address:', resolverAddress);
           // You may need to inspect the resolver contract for custom logic
           // Use ethers.js or web3.js to interact with the resolver contract
       } else {
           console.log('Schema does not have a resolver.');
       }
   }

   checkResolver('<YourSchemaID>');

Please try the steps above to check the schema existence and whether it has a resolver with custom logic. If you encounter any issues or if the schema exists but the attestation is still being rejected, let me know, and we can delve deeper into the resolver logic or other potential issues."
"Hi, which method I can get whole UID that attest with this schema with EAS SDK in Typescript?",Not sure what you mean. Can you rephrase the question?,"To get all UIDs that attest with a specific schema using the EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) SDK in TypeScript, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the EAS SDK**: You need to set up the EAS SDK with the appropriate provider and schema.

2. **Query Attestations**: Use the methods provided by the SDK to query attestations based on the schema.

Here’s a step-by-step example of how you can achieve this:

### Step 1: Install EAS SDK

First, ensure you have the EAS SDK installed in your project. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install @ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk
```

### Step 2: Initialize the EAS SDK

Initialize the SDK with the necessary configuration:

```typescript
import { EAS, SchemaRegistry } from '@ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Initialize the provider (e.g., with a default provider or your own)
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('YOUR_RPC_URL');

// Initialize EAS and SchemaRegistry
const eas = new EAS(provider);
const schemaRegistry = new SchemaRegistry(provider);
```

### Step 3: Query Attestations by Schema

Assuming you have the schema ID you want to query, you can use the SDK to fetch attestations related to this schema:

```typescript
const schemaId = 'YOUR_SCHEMA_ID';

async function getAttestationUIDsBySchema(schemaId: string) {
  try {
    // Fetch attestations related to the schema
    const attestations = await eas.getAttestations({ schema: schemaId });

    // Extract UIDs from the attestations
    const uids = attestations.map(attestation => attestation.uid);
    
    return uids;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching attestations:', error);
    return [];
  }
}

(async () => {
  const uids = await getAttestationUIDsBySchema(schemaId);
  console.log('Attestation UIDs:', uids);
})();
```

### Notes:
- Replace `'YOUR_RPC_URL'` with the actual RPC URL of your Ethereum provider.
- Replace `'YOUR_SCHEMA_ID'` with the actual schema ID you are interested in.
- Ensure you handle errors and edge cases as needed.

This example demonstrates how to initialize the EAS SDK, query attestations based on a schema, and extract the UIDs from those attestations.

Try this approach and let me know if it works for you."
I mean how solution to get all attestation that use this scheme via Typescript SDK?,Like .getAllAttestation() or something,"To get all attestations that use a specific scheme via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) using the TypeScript SDK, you will typically interact with the EAS smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

1. **Setup Your Project:**
   Ensure you have a Node.js project with TypeScript configured. If not, you can set it up using the following commands:
   ```bash
   mkdir eas-project
   cd eas-project
   npm init -y
   npm install typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev
   npx tsc --init
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   Install the necessary EAS SDK and ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain:
   ```bash
   npm install @ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk ethers
   ```

3. **Initialize EAS SDK:**
   Create a TypeScript file (e.g., `index.ts`) and initialize the EAS SDK with the necessary Ethereum provider.

   ```typescript
   import { ethers } from 'ethers';
   import { EAS, SchemaEncoder } from '@ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk';

   // Connect to Ethereum provider (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, or local node)
   const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL');

   // Initialize EAS with the provider
   const eas = new EAS(provider);
   ```

4. **Fetch Attestations Using a Specific Scheme:**
   To fetch attestations, you will need to interact with the EAS smart contract. You can use the `getAttestations` function of the EAS SDK to query attestations based on a specific scheme.

   ```typescript
   async function getAttestationsByScheme(schemeId: string) {
     try {
       const attestations = await eas.getAttestations({
         schema: schemeId,
         limit: 100, // Adjust the limit as needed
       });

       return attestations;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error fetching attestations:', error);
     }
   }

   // Replace with your actual scheme ID
   const schemeId = 'YOUR_SCHEME_ID';

   getAttestationsByScheme(schemeId).then(attestations => {
     if (attestations) {
       console.log('Attestations:', attestations);
     }
   });
   ```

5. **Run Your Script:**
   Execute your script using `ts-node`:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node index.ts
   ```

This will fetch and log all attestations that use the specified scheme. Make sure to replace `'YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL'` with your actual Ethereum node URL and `'YOUR_SCHEME_ID'` with the actual scheme ID you are interested in.
