A contract accepts a payment and forwards it to a recipient. Aside from simple p2p tips, the recipient can also be a pubic goods project (for example one that is currently participating in a gitcoin round). In this case, I want the contract to attest that the donor supports public goods. I found an example contract that makes on-chain attestations and tried following it, so this is the function call I am using:', {'type': 'pre', 'text': 'function _attestDonor(address _publicGood, uint256 _amount) internal returns (bytes32) {        return            _eas.attest(                AttestationRequest({                    schema: SCHEMA_UID,                    data: AttestationRequestData({                        recipient: address(0), // No recipient                        expirationTime: NO_EXPIRATION_TIME, // No expiration time                        revocable: false,                        refUID: EMPTY_UID, // No references UI                        data: abi.encode(msg.sender, _publicGood, _amount), // Encode sender, grantee address and amount                         value: 0 // No value/ETH                    })                })            );    }', 'language': ''}, 'I am trying to understand where this could fail.

Would the opposite work (schema allows revocation, but attest call sets revocable to false)? Another question I am facing is regarding the role of the recipient. Would it make more sense to set the donor address as the recipient of an attestation, or would it be better to have the donor as one of the inputs of the attestation (like in my function above with msg.sender)?

Steve Dakh | EAS said I think it makes sense to use the recipient field for the donor as it would be an attestation to the doner that they tipped. 

As far as revocable, if schema revocability is true then attestations can be revocable or not. If it’s false, attestations must all have revocable be set to false or they will fail. at 2023-07-31 03:08:19 : replied to :126

Bryce | EAS said Hey Bill, unfortunately we don't have plans to deploy on zkSync era before ETHToronto. We've been in discussions with them and are working towards a deployment, however, it wont be before August 15th. We're currently focused on a few other deployments before then.

Feel free to deploy the contracts for the hackathon. As for the GraphQL endpoint - I'd have to sync with the rest of the team on if that might be possible before then. Stay tuned. 🙏 at 2023-08-05 08:16:15 : replied to :167

We've got two major concerns that we'd like you to help us :)1 - We're currentely testing on Sepolia only, and when we attest off-chain, it doesn't show up in the attestation count of the schema and also in the API responses, although we can access the attestation by it's UID.

Bryce | EAS said ['Hey ', {'type': 'mention', 'text': '@muryandre'}, ", thanks for all the detail! Looking forward to seeing the product soon.#1 - Offchain attestations by default are made private and not public. They will only show up on the explorer sites if they are made available on IPFS and indexed by us. This gives users the option to how public or private they want their attestations to be and where it gets stored. We're also looking at other decentralized storage options like Ceramic. Here's a sample dapp repo you can look at to see how to leverage our indexer for offchain attestations. ", {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/met-irl/tree/offchain'}, '#2 - Any customization to the sequence of how attestations are made would be done by setting a resolver contract. You can multi attest attestations but if they are relational to something, you need to make sure that attestation was actually made. That way you can rely on its authenticity before referencing it. To be clear:Basically when you do multiAttest you provide all of the attestation details in one shot but you can’t possibly know the ids before they are all made so you’d have to sequentially make the attestations. One solution is to write a custom smart contract with the logic you want to be able to loop through and make one attestation at a time.'] at 2023-08-18 22:47:00 : replied to :2

Afo Wefa said Are there technical diagrams of how the resolver works? 

Still trying to wrap my head around how the relayer for example can mint an NFT.

Right now my understadning is EAS is running a relay service that hits the resolver upon an attestation. From that it seems a paymaster would be needed to cover transaction cost. at 2023-08-29 10:47:05 : replied to :2

Steve Dakh | EAS said EAS is simply two smart contracts. A schema registry (to register types of attestations) and an attestation ledger where every attestation references a specific schema.

A resolver is an optional smart contract that can be set when registering a new schema that gets called anytime someone tries to attest or revoke an attestation of that specific schema. This allows for any kind of smart contract functionality like for example minting an NFT based on the attestation input. at 2023-08-30 20:32:07 : replied to :409

Afo Wefa said Gotcha, so the attesters EOA make the attestaion and that also calls the resolver, so it's a single transaction. at 2023-08-31 04:07:59 : replied to :413

Steve Dakh | EAS said Correct. The attester can also be a smart contract at 2023-08-31 04:10:44 : replied to :415
Steve Dakh | EAS said resolver only ever gets called with onchain attest() or revoke() calls at 2023-08-31 04:11:25 : replied to :2
Afo Wefa said Oof any plan to support timestamps? 

With my use case around live events where a lot of attestations will be happening if it could done off chain then brought on I think that can scale as with going completely on chain can cause issues with cost and network. 

Any suggestions for how to approach this? at 2023-08-31 04:20:33 : replied to :418
Steve Dakh | EAS said What would be the purpose of this? Timestamp functionality only records the UID of an offchain attestation, theres no schema recorded. at 2023-08-31 04:22:20 : replied to :419

Afo Wefa said I see, yea timestamps wuldn't work, with just the UUID.

I've also been working with PolygonID and in that framework, I can have a verifier on chain, while generating claims/credentials off chain. 

I would like to do something similar with EAS but maybe PolygonID suit my usecase better not sure. at 2023-08-31 05:23:04 : replied to :421

links said So I started playing around with EAS today and ran into an issue. 

I'm trying to create a schema using the SDK using Alchemy as a provider (to read from sepolia) and an EOA wallet as a signer.

When I use schemaRegistry.connect(signer); i get an error saying I am missing a provider.  
When I use schemaRegistry.connect(provider); i get an error saying I need a signer.

Mahesh | karmahq.xyz said Hello, we are trying to figure out how to do multiple attestations in one transaction and have a question. 

We need to make 3 attestations A,B,C but B references A and C references B. So I wrote a contract to do it. So user has to execute only one txn (custom contract call). But the problem is, attester on those attestations will be contract address and not user. I thought of using delegated attestation but that requires user signature on all three attestations, so thy are signing thrice. What's the best way to solve this so user  simply signs once? at 2023-08-31 09:19:22 : replied to :2

Steve Dakh | EAS said Can you please share your repo or code, chainID, and ethers and eas sdk version at 2023-08-31 19:00:56 : replied to :427
Steve Dakh | EAS said There are a few ways to go about this. 

1. Generate your own identifiers and reference the attestations by them. 

2. In the schema include an address field representing the entity who is calling the method. 

3. Combining the attestations into a single attestation. Perhaps you don’t need to attest separately.

4. Breaking them down into multiple transactions. Perhaps many attestations reference only one attestation. In this case you can have only two transactions (one for the initial referenced attestation, and one for the batch) at 2023-08-31 19:17:09 : replied to :428
Mahesh | karmahq.xyz said Thanks. 3 is not an option. 4 could work. 2 might be a good compromise I think. I am curious about 1 - generate own identifier. Can you share more on how this would work or point me to something? at 2023-08-31 19:31:40 : replied to :432
Jemiah said So did I miss the part where you’d find the EAS contract address? The schema data only shows uid, creator, & transaction id… everything I’ve tried I keep getting an empty output or an error, when attesting through JavaScript on base goerli… at 2023-08-31 19:44:50 : replied to :2

Jemiah said ok yes I used the base goerli address but it’s coming up empty & saying my schema isn’t revocable although it should show true. I will create a new one & try again. thank you at 2023-08-31 19:53:42 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said The idea would be to manually create for example a random bytes32 value for the initial attestation and put it in the data. In the schema it could be for example “…, bytes32 id” and in other attestation types can be “…, bytes32 reference” referencing this same generated id. This is obviously not as clean and you’d have to manage your own indexing of these fields. 

I agree that #4 is probably best followed by #2 at 2023-08-31 19:57:29 : replied to :433

Do you have an overview who is already using the protocol? Any brands outside the core web3 community? At work I am currently thinking about a way of fan loyalty mechanism using soul bound tokens. After listening to you on Bankless I have a feeling attestations might be a valid option too. However what is most important to me would be easy adoption for interoperability between web2 and even offline brands. With SBT solutions like Tokenproof would make this probably a lot less painful. at 2023-09-12 00:42:48 : replied to :537

Steve Dakh | EAS said As entities build up a bunch of attestations about themselves that overall can represent their reputation as well as make many attestations, they will be less likely to sell their private key. at 2023-09-12 01:08:34 : replied to :None
Lukas said Not so much different from SBTs, isn't it? When I look at this the much larger benefit I see is the cost efficiency that comes from the choice of putting data on chain or not while still giving the person who received the attestation the chance to use it verifiably with a third party. When I think about issuing a couple of attestations that doesn't matter too much. But if I want to attest to millions that they watched a match or an episode of a series this would be huge. at 2023-09-12 01:40:21 : replied to :547
Steve Dakh | EAS said This is why EAS also has an offchain protocol for attesting using EIP712. These offchain attestations are free to make and portable, timestampable, and can be completely private. We believe most attestations people will make will be offchain and perhaps only timestamped onchain. at 2023-09-12 01:47:08 : replied to :548

Ⓧ🄷❸🄱④🆂Ⓓ said Hello, I am xh3, working on a Web2/Web3 hybrid experiment application. Ever since I found out about EAS I thought this is totally the right direction for us to move towards as a (crypto) community. I was always wondering what we and I in particular could build with it. Now I am working on a web app and I am brainstorming about several use cases for EAS to be integrated into the tech stack I am working on. There are two main fields I would like to address with the use of EAS, if possible. 

For one, moderation. I am building a sort of consumer app for creators, which requires the moderation of content. Usually you need to build all the permission management yourself and do RBAC magic and what not. I was thinking to use EAS to attest to user permissions so that I can attest to users on the platform to have a certain role, like moderator or administrator. The Web2 platform would then consider the attestions periodically based on the onchain state and eventually the community maybe even self organizes permissions in a decentralized way. What a priviledged role can do within the Web2 app stays within the context of its own offchain code base, but I think it would be cool to have the process of granting moderation privileges and the granted state to be transparently available onchain. I guess this one is doable and I would like to hear your feedback or ideas on that. 

And second, accounting. In my project there are some kind of free market dynamics between producers and consumers. The idea is to compensate producers, the creators of content on the platform, based on the subscriptions the consumers pay, and based on the consumption behaviour of the provided content. So if you are a producer you should earn a revenue share of the platform proportionally to the amount of generated consumption on the platform. I want the payments to be fully onchain. Subscriptions might be done via something like Superfluid. I think we do not need attestions for that because the payment itself is the ultimate attestion for the purpose of paying. What I think should be attested to is the creation of content and the consumption of it. Now the question is how this can be done in a somewhat trustless but also frictionless way. If a producer creates content, the platform should attest to the user having created the content, without burdening the user to do more than creating the content itself on the web app. Same for consumers, if somebody clicks a link for instance, I would like the platform to attest to that action so that the producers of the consumed content is credited with a point or something. At the end of the accounting cycle the platform calculates who is owed what based on the attested contributions and producers are free to withdraw their revenue share from a smart contract. This one might be more tricky because of the way attestions have to be made. I was wondering if attestations could be collected within the web app for an hour or so, and if it would be possible for any user to attest the batch of attestions recorded on the web app without the user being able to temper with the attested data. I am not sure if this is like an account abstraction approach or if it is even possible to make it trustless and self serving at the same time. I would like to minimize the key management the web app has to do only to attest to user behaviour onchain and I do not want to burden anyone all the time to get the hardware wallet out and sign transactions. I would love to hear your thoughts on this one too. 

Since there is a lot going on here I would also be happy to jump on a call and discuss this in detail if anyone is interested or to move the conversation to a more suitable place. I do not need all the answers right now but maybe we can kick it off and see what we can do with EAS. 🤍 at 2023-09-13 21:36:35 : replied to :2

Bryce | EAS said Both use cases are incredibly important to solve for. Granting permissions for any sort of community governance, like content moderation, is a good use for attestations. Also, attestations can be used as a way to enable more interoperability of the content that is created. The UI's could manage and filter the content appropriate for that user group or community thereafter.

Would love to chat further about your use case #2 so we can fully understand it/explore it with you. There's a few ideas I have around offchain attestations, but determining their relevance for this use case and at what stage is important. at 2023-09-14 00:53:07 : replied to :580

Ⓧ🄷❸🄱④🆂Ⓓ said Thanks a lot for the feedback and the energy here. Content rating and UI based selection is an interesting idea for the future. 

I was digging through your docs today and your SDK and everything. I started to play around with registering schemes locally. I can make my way for the moderation part in my infra how I see fit. 

Would really love to brainstorm together and am happy to share what's on my mind with everything. Hit me up any time. In the docs I saw delegated attestations, which sounds super promising. Right now I just miss some understanding on how this technically works and what guarantees or implications this approach brings with it. So, onwards then! at 2023-09-14 04:33:22 : replied to :584

At some point the recipient of that grant may want to revoke its own role. Right now that does not seem to be possible. I was wondering what you guys think about an option at schema level to not only allow revocations for that schema, but also allow recipients of attestions to revoke themselves.

Steve Dakh | EAS said If someone attests negatively to you in response to some bad business it wouldn’t be great if you could just make it go away at 2023-09-15 19:07:42 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said Instead if you could attest with a response I think that makes the system much more composable and understandable at 2023-09-15 19:08:29 : replied to :2
Ⓧ🄷❸🄱④🆂Ⓓ said Then let's say you have been granted a role and you don't want it anymore. What would be the schema and attestation you would submit in order to opt out of your granted role or responsibility? at 2023-09-15 19:10:23 : replied to :622
Steve Dakh | EAS said renounceRole at 2023-09-15 19:11:13 : replied to :623
Ⓧ🄷❸🄱④🆂Ⓓ said Ok, so I have my own schema for attesting to roles and the system understands the native approach of revocations for computing permissions within my system based on the attestation graph. And now there is some out of band schema that I hope somebody uses in order to reflect their desire to quit. I think building with native revocations is more intuitive and simpler than considering another schema, that the system may just not know about. So as described above, it would be really cool to simply say if recipient is msg.sender let them revoke, if the schema allows for that of course. at 2023-09-15 19:23:00 : replied to :624

Steve Dakh | EAS said Taking vs giving back at 2023-09-15 19:25:49 : replied to :628
Steve Dakh | EAS said I understand your use case. You can also have a smart contract that issues the attestations of roles. When the user asks contract to revoke the contract can revoke it for the user at 2023-09-15 19:26:46 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said In fact in many cases the attester will be a contract anyway at 2023-09-15 19:27:11 : replied to :2
Bryce | EAS said In the example of rage quitting - The user experience of this would still require some sort of intent from a user to say they are quitting. Without explicitly asking for permission. 

This experience is easily handled imo at the application layer where a user renounces (resigns) their role and the issuer of the role revokes it (could be programmatic). Very similar to a termination of a web2 job. 

Imagine a different scenario, where someone is banned from your community and added to a list. What if the user could rage quit that list and no longer be banned? This is why controlling this at the user experience can be more appropriate. It also highlights the significance of schema composability and revocations to handle a wide variety of scenarios. at 2023-09-15 20:14:49 : replied to :2

Steve Dakh | EAS said Gitcoin badges can expire or be revoked by Gitcoin. The idea is that a dapp will typically require some minimum score for a particular address. If you’ve already filled the requirement then you wouldn’t need to update the attestation. at 2023-09-20 19:23:34 : replied to :674
Diky said 🙋‍♂️ question

Can the attest issued/filled/attested by only one party then "given" to someone else?

Steve Dakh | EAS said EAS and polygonID serve two separate purposes. EAS is simply a base layer/protocol for onchain and offchain attestations, while PolygonID allows you to make zk proofs about on or offchain data. 

As such you can use them together for example by creating a smart contract that verifies a polygonID proof and makes an attestation if valid at 2023-09-21 17:09:00 : replied to :694
Steve Dakh | EAS said Since offchain attestations follow the eip712 standard, they can be read and verified onchain by smart contracts. Be aware though that it would be cheaper to have the attestation onchain in the first place rather than having to read it after the fact. So if you plan to bring it onchain it might be better to just start with onchain. at 2023-09-21 17:10:24 : replied to :695

Christian P said Thank you very much, is EAS compliant with the new standard openbadge 3.0? Or is something that must be builded with polygonId at 2023-09-21 17:34:02 : replied to :704
Christian P said Anyway i'm playing with EAS now, very very cool, a lot of stuff can be build on at 2023-09-21 17:34:57 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said EAS is a blockchain first protocol whereas VCs and open badges are really meant for offchain use and come with a lot of overhead. You can achieve the same exact outcomes using attestations. at 2023-09-21 17:48:50 : replied to :711

Christian P said Another question, I'm just try to think eadge cases. if i have to certified 100000 users, i should use markle proof, i suppose, but, how can i then build a ui, to show all the users certificates, without know if that user is elegible for that certificate? I'm not talking about the detail page, but the certification lists page. Do you suggest some patterns in particular, i would like to not call my db, only on chain at 2023-09-21 21:15:52 : replied to :2

Bryce | EAS said Would you mind describing your use case in more detail? What’s an example of the certificate and how someone might be using your UI? at 2023-09-21 21:28:48 : replied to :2
Christian P said I'm building a private dashboard where issuer can issue certificate. The flow, issuer certificate that the course exist, than the teachers should certificate the users who surpassed the exam based on some criteria. At this point l, i could have a lot of students in a class, so i think is not a good choice issue with multiAttest. After the releasing each users can log in a dedicated ui, where can see their certificates, paginated. This is my use case. at 2023-09-21 22:21:11 : replied to :2
Christian P said At the moment i have a custom smart contract for tracking this steps, but is not standard. It's owr logic. I this is better built on a protocol dedicated at 2023-09-21 22:23:26 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said Do you need these certificates to actually be read on chain? If not then offchain attestations could be useful to you. You can also attest onchain to a merkle root of a bunch of offchain attestations that can be proven later onchain if needed at 2023-09-21 23:43:58 : replied to :724

Steve Dakh | EAS said [{'type': 'mention', 'text': '@krideveth'}, ' Two other options:1. Delegated attestations where the user pays for their own certificate (this is how gitcoin passport uses EAS)2.

Christian P said The gas is not a problem, because we implemented account abstraction, so issuers, teachers users do not have to worry about. So in the first case, the user generate the badge himself? The second option is interesting, so i should save all the address on the certification? And maybe  then make a query to get all the issuer certificatations where in a specific filed is included the address? at 2023-09-22 00:30:27 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said In the first case I gave the attestation still comes from the same attester address you/contract owns, but it’s paid by the recipient. at 2023-09-22 01:00:46 : replied to :728

Bryce | EAS said ['Great job building this ', {'type': 'mention', 'text': '@kristoferkristofer'}, '! Here\'s some quick feedback as I went through the experience. Overall, very clean design and I love the simplicity of it. Excited to see where you take it and how others contribute more ways to build reputations towards citizen eligibility!#1 As a new user, it might be helpful to know what the eligibility criteria is to become a new OP Citizen (link out to the OP docs perhaps). Consider adding it as it’s own dedicated page and encourage users how they can increase their chances for eligibility. This would be a good place to clarify why Praise, Regen Score, Optimist, and Passport Scores are important.#2 It’s not immediately obvious what the attestation record is about. Knowing that this is a curated experience it affords you a lot of design flexibility to make the attestation records really pop. For example... unless there are multiple tags for 1 particular attestation, I’d recommend using the tag as part of the attestation title/label. i.e. calling the “Optimist” attestations as “Optimist Attestations” and removing the label in the component. Then It might be worth moving the description immediately under the title of the attestation record. Followed by the details section. This might improve the design a bit, but not immediately necessary.#3 It would be great to suggest additional schemas or applications to use attestations as a form of reputation building for the citizen selection process going beyond Praise, Passports, Optimist profiles etc. I could imagine that this list will grow over time, so it would be great to keep a list of the active projects and also encourage others to build more reputation-based dapps.#4 Consider creating a leaderboard for "Top Optimists" that give people a good representation of what a strong citizen profile really looks like. Then encourage them to make the steps towards that.'] at 2023-09-26 22:26:55 : replied to :779

Kristofer said Thanks for great detailed feedback! Some of it we can implement right away, some of it we will save for a future iteration.

Regarding the eligibility criteria, those are not yet decided. Currently citizens are hand picked/nominated by citizens from previous rounds. So, basically, currently attestations are not used at all. We built this explorer as a way to nudge OP in the direction of starting to use attestations for eligibility, given there are enough high quality attestations of course. But for now, perhaps we will add an About page that more clearly describes the current state of eligibility and wherer we hope it is heading. at 2023-09-27 14:51:36 : replied to :819

Steve Dakh | EAS said Can you share repo with your code so we can debug. 

With delegated attestations entity A can sign an attestation where any entity with the signature can pay for it and the attestations still comes from A. You can also just have an ownable contract that attests on your behalf at 2023-09-27 23:32:40 : replied to :835

Steve Dakh | EAS said Sorry for the late response! With the attestations made from easscan using the private data schema, the attestation only has the root hash of the merkle tree of data. In order to create the proof you have to have the original data you want to prove. The implementation uses open zeppelins  merkle-tree library. We will be adding the functionality directly into the SDK soon. at 2023-09-28 02:17:45 : replied to :798

Nic @ ⛵️ said Hello, I found the episode on Bankless very interesting but too technical and hard to grasp as a non-technical (marketer) person. however, i could tell that the discussion was interesting and wasn't sure where to start with my questions. So I put the transcript in perplexity ai and threw a few questions at it. It helped me a lot, first of all I wasn't sure whether attestations were a sort of token or not (they aren't).. anyways I wanted to ask if others would be interested in working together to further explore the EAS ecosystem with me (ideally with less technical jargon) at 2023-10-07 18:02:03 : replied to :None

Afo Wefa said I’m working on connecting NFTs with NFC chips for physical art and have been mulling over the architecture. I was thinking I could use attestations for some aspect of the process, one for adding the NFC on chain, another for binding the NFC with an NFT, and lastly for transferring ownership of art. I know I could do this with my own contracts but feel there’s some potential with EAS, any thoughts? at 2023-10-09 04:28:59 : replied to :2
Mark said Hi all, anyone have any examples of delegated attestations I can look at? at 2023-10-09 16:17:11 : replied to :2
Moonid said The provenance of the piece can be attested to on EAS for each new owner. You can make a schema where the current owner attests to the transfer to the new owner.

It may be possible for the buyer to fund a custom resolver contract with the full purchase price, and that is released to the seller only when they attest that the ownership has been transferred at 2023-10-09 17:59:44 : replied to :937
Moonid said That way the ownership transfer happens atomically and the buyer doesn't have to worry that the seller won't sign the new ownership attestation after they pay at 2023-10-09 18:00:36 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said Another way is to not use an NFT and simply have the NFC with an attestation to the NFCs identifier attesting to the validity of the asset at 2023-10-09 18:24:16 : replied to :2

Mark said awesome thanks at 2023-10-09 18:27:59 : replied to :942
Afo Wefa said Interesting, the NFT asset is used to create a Tokenbound account that will be used for different functionality on the art and also want to be able to message holders of an art piece. Do u think this functionality can be done without an NFT? at 2023-10-09 18:51:25 : replied to :941
Steve Dakh | EAS said If you require tracking of the owner the probably adding NFTs makes sense but then it MUST be transferred with any physical transfer. at 2023-10-09 19:38:16 : replied to :944
Afo Wefa said Yep totally, rn I’m focused on the transfer disregarding price. Seller (Artist/Buyer) initiates transfer via attestation the resolver contract updates the NFT Tokenbound account state to a pending owner that can fire the claim function during a period of time. Now on the physical side which is murky to me technically as I learn more about NFC . I envision it working in a way where the new buyer can tap the NFC and get a signature that can be verified on chain and they can then claim ownership of the art at 2023-10-09 19:58:13 : replied to :945
Steve Dakh | EAS said Tapping the NFC could go to a page that has the attestation from creator attesting to the identifier of the NFC with the NFT contract address and tokenId. The NFT then would just be transferred with physical artwork at 2023-10-09 21:13:58 : replied to :946
Dave H said Thanks for the reply here. I’ve recently been looking into this and I have a draft of a white paper to solve the problem of calculating trust of claims in an attestations network. Anyone open to discussing it? at 2023-10-09 22:42:53 : replied to :808

Steve Dakh | EAS said you can make an offchain attestation of any schema. Probably since this is a novel concept you are attesting to, you’d probably want to create your own schema that represents the data you will be attesting to.

andy said so I would make a schema called "Do the Dishes" and I could send it to my kid via Qr code (with a good interface or something), Or I make an attestation that it was done, and I send it to whatever address my kid is using so there is onchain record that they did the thing (or ifps) at 2023-10-11 02:41:56 : replied to :None

Steve Dakh | EAS said You can think of it like running an IPFS node that streams new additions and also allows you to index everything. You can have other entities subscribe to your streams so the data (attestations in this case) can be distributed at 2023-10-12 03:10:04 : replied to :1002
Jeremy | Gitcoin Passport said We stream all attestations from Gitcoin Passport to a Ceramic node we run and publish onchain using EAS, it's a great combo for us! at 2023-10-12 03:26:47 : replied to :1002
Dave H said You do it on optimism only right? It still costs something? at 2023-10-12 03:27:45 : replied to :1004
Jeremy | Gitcoin Passport said All of the attestations on Ceramic do not have a cost (other than us running the node). The OP attestations and soon Linea, do have a gas cost to the end user to push onchain as anything on chain would, plus we're charging a $2 'mint fee' to the treasury in addition at 2023-10-12 03:34:38 : replied to :1005
Alex Poon | CharmVerse said Why are you doing both? at 2023-10-12 03:35:08 : replied to :1006
Steve Dakh | EAS said So users can take their offchain attestations/scores brought on chain for access by other smart contracts at 2023-10-12 04:02:37 : replied to :1007
Alex Poon | CharmVerse said But why both? If the attestations are going on chain, why ceramic? at 2023-10-12 04:04:01 : replied to :1008
Christian said that is so sick at 2023-10-12 04:05:18 : replied to :1004
Jeremy | Gitcoin Passport said We don't necessarily want or need all users to bring their Passports onchain. at 2023-10-12 04:05:29 : replied to :1009
Jeremy | Gitcoin Passport said This gives us the option to have a 0 gas cost transaction for a majority of users, while still publishing all of the data publically as an open protocol at 2023-10-12 04:06:09 : replied to :None
Jeremy | Gitcoin Passport said Then users can take the pacakage of attestations and move them onchain in a single transaction and we get all of the goodness of EAS when we do regardless of the chain we push to at 2023-10-12 04:06:34 : replied to :None

Afo Wefa said Here's the last part of the flow showing a collector buying art. Here I have 3 attestations, which I'm guessing could be either a single schema or three. Also was wondering if an artist forgets to approve a transfer should a collector still be able to claim the token, maybe time comes into play here and/or a signature generating mechanism on the art chip that can be verified on chain. 

This then bring the other case of the art somehow being stolen in a manner to where a malicious art transfered is created by hacking the REST API, so they can manipulate the recipient. They then can attest to transfer complete, however if the artist becomes aware and doesn't approve transfer and the collector attests to the failed transfer it serves as a public record of the art being stolen. 

Not sure what a revocery process would like but can think of later. at 2023-10-12 17:01:15 : replied to :947

Christian P said Hey, i have a service that release onchain attestation based on some criteria. People that calls my api pass some data about the course and the user. But i have some problems/questions. How can i attest and attention, if the user information doesn't  have an address? Ideally, i should attest the course result to the user address right? Should i leave empty the receiver? Second question how can I handle the privacy of this user data?my first approach is encrypted data, and set the user information as an encrypted data. So that only the dapp can decrypt. But i don't think is the best approach. at 2023-10-15 00:01:50 : replied to :2

Bryce | EAS said It depends on the user flow. Multiple schemas make sense if you want to benefit from more composability. Generally, it's best not to repeat yourself with data so if you have an opportunity to make it more composable, do so. 

What types of schemas are you thinking about? at 2023-10-19 07:14:30 : replied to :2
Afo Wefa said So was thinking either just  GoodTransfer with a status property or going with these 4

GoodTransferStarted
GoodTransferApproved
GoodTransferCompleted
GoodTransferFailed at 2023-10-19 07:16:54 : replied to :2
Bryce | EAS said Consider making it one schema and having the status be a uint category type. 

Example provenance schema:
uint8 status // a int value of the status categories
bytes id // the product id if it’s not registered as an Attestation at 2023-10-19 07:41:28 : replied to :2

My question is if attest can be transferred from user to user because users basically can trade their percent or full ownership of an NFT.

Steve Dakh | EAS said Feel free to DM or ask here at 2023-10-24 18:19:21 : replied to :1145
Fractal Visions said Sure 👍 thanks 🙏..
I am inquiring to explore the possibility of using EAS to store user data when they setup their profile on our platform. 

We have been working with Kwil to establish a decentralized SQL database system and wondering what some pros vs cons are or if these two things are not comparable. So I guess my question is related to EAS use case being scaled on a manageable level. 

sha is the format the data is stored in rather than actual files?

And this info can also be abstracted to keep the users data storage private while still being able to display images or info on their bio? at 2023-10-24 19:03:57 : replied to :1146
ollie said Hi! is there a way of retrieving all attestationIds for a given address directly onchain? at 2023-10-24 20:00:56 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said By default, EAS does not index attestations (for massive gas optimization). We are going to release a new indexing contract shortly where you will be able to call an indexAttestation(attestationUid) method which will index the attestation by schema/recipient/attester. Any contract can then call this indexer and ask about specific attestations an address has indexed. at 2023-10-24 20:13:29 : replied to :1148
Steve Dakh | EAS said Attestation data is formatted depending on the schema you choose to attest with. It can have any number/types of fields. ANything attested to onchain on EAS is not private by default. You can use different encryption/hashing mechanisms to add a layer of privacy. EAS does not presuppose what people will attest to or what formats they will use, we offer a few examples however. at 2023-10-24 20:17:52 : replied to :1147
Fractal Visions said Thanks 🙏 for the answer. I’ll work with my developer team to see what the best option is. Can EAS be utilized to replace an SQL user database? 

I just want to make sure that I am looking in the right place. at 2023-10-24 21:01:49 : replied to :1150
Steve Dakh | EAS said You would not want to put an SQL database onchain as the gas cost for indexing and running SQL queries would be insane and would eventually require more gas that can fit into a block. 

By default EAS only indexes attestations onchain by UID. We have an Indexing contract where you can optionally add indexing by attester/recipient/schema. EAS is NOT made to be a replacement for an SQL database. In some ways it can act like a database in that it stores attestation data and allows contracts to verify it, but by default you would not be able to query onchain. Its only after you index offchain that you can query the data efficiently. at 2023-10-24 21:07:21 : replied to :1151
Fractal Visions said Awesome 👏 thanks.. I have passed this note to our team. Our smart contract engineer is going to dig into EAS docs and see what we can come up with because yes a kwil node costs about $1000 per month which is fast and keeps all the customers data secure. at 2023-10-24 21:22:10 : replied to :1152

Kody Sale said Hey guys, hopping in here to see if my use case makes sense. We built Smoothly, a tool for solo staker to pool together their execution layer rewards from block proposals. We're 12 weeks out from mainnet, and are putting together a campaign to increase the number of independent stakers on the network. In essence, our goal is to incentivize solo staking and slow the growth of the large staking providers. 

With that out of the way, over the next 12 weeks we're going to approach ecosystem projects who may be willing to contribute to the cause. My thought was that EAS could be a useful tool to allow projects to commit to donations on chain. Since the donations wont happen until our mainnet contract is deployed, it would allow us to track, on chain an transparently with our users, the commitments we receive. 

I assumed that there would be an existing schema for something like this, but it looks like we might need to get one going! at 2023-10-25 03:39:04 : replied to :None

Steve Dakh | EAS said VCs were designed before blockchains came into prominence. EAS attestations are built with blockchain in mind so they are verifiable on and offchain. EAS has a global schema registry. Attestations can expire, be revoked, reference other attestations, be timestamped or revoked onchain, as well as be on or offchain. Offchain attestations are also MUCH more lightweight than VCs. at 2023-10-28 17:42:19 : replied to :1199

Stephan Mauracher said Ok.  Because a open permissionless standard would be perfect. The FDA/EMA could define the schemes and all the research done on medical products is hashed, timestamped on the blockchain. In combination with a CMS you create a tamper-proof audit trail that fits the FDA/EMA standards.

Steve Dakh | EAS said Correct, this is why we have added the onchain timestamp method to be able to timestamp offchain attestations onchain by UID. This can also be done in large batches for very cheap. Soon we will begin allowing users to submit any uids and we will batch them for free at 2023-10-31 19:24:25 : replied to :1225
Stephan Mauracher said Ah ok. So I could create a bunch of off-chain attestation and then put a batch of UID onchain to create tamper-proof time stamps for all the attestations. correct? at 2023-10-31 20:08:12 : replied to :None
Stephan Mauracher said Because the issue would be if a  pharma company uses a CMS/QMS system it would probably not put all attestations onchain even though they include no real data. Because then the public could analyze the metadata and see how active they are. Particulary if schemes are involved. The tamper-proofed time stamps however are crucial. 🤔. So can you still extract the metadata like "number of attestations" from the UID batches comitted to the chain? at 2023-10-31 20:14:21 : replied to :None

Bryce | EAS said They are offering up to 3 verifications per user. So you can choose which addresses you want verified or don't. The verification shows the address being a verified account but doesn't reveal more than that. at 2023-11-12 22:31:10 : replied to :1303
Kristofer said Cool, I’ll go and check it out 👍

Btw, do you know if someone is building the next logical attestation layer? Composable attestations/aggregate attestations? For example, I might want to create attestations for users that can show:
1. They are Coinbase users and.. 
2. They have a Passport score above X and..
3. They are an active contributor to community X based on Praise attestations

Combine the insights from any number of attestation types to create new attestation types. Features:
- Define custom rulesets in some UI
- Create attestation schemas based on those rulesets
- Create the attestations

Kristofer said Yeah, it would be a fun build! Don’t need more projects on my plate atm though, but it is tempting 😂

Projects (like Guild) would be the typical users/consumers of these aggragate attestations. Instead of each project having to build their own rule engine (like Guild have), projects would use a common rule engine and create attestations based on the outcomes. Aggregate attestations can be used/reused between projects and platforms. The aggregate attestation “OP Power Contributor” would be used by Guild to give access to Discord, by some Snaphot stratetgy to give access to voting and so on. at 2023-11-13 02:12:09 : replied to :1307
Kristofer said Sounds great, look forward to seeing that rule builder UI!  There’s a lot that should go in there, it will be a fun UI challenge.

Bryce | EAS said The metrics you're showing are not gitcoin specific, they are representing the total amount of attestations, the unique attesters (addresses that have made an attestation), and # offchain attestations that have been made public on that chain.

The attestations on OP mainnet increased ~50k+ yesterday due to OP making governance co-grant attestations for participating. They are a single addresses attesting to a large # of people!

Koshik Raj said Thanks, Bryce, Have been digging around Gitcoin stamps and EAS. Looks like a subset of this feature is exactly what we need 🤝 at 2023-11-17 11:25:02 : replied to :1349

Steve Dakh | EAS said You can use the Web3Provider class in ethers to wrap a web3 provider at 2023-11-17 17:36:40 : replied to :1390
Leo said The SDK expects an object with a signing function (I’m not in front a computer, so can’t tell you the exact signature). If you’ll pass an object of your exposing such function and internally uses web3.js - it’ll work at 2023-11-17 17:36:53 : replied to :None

Dan said IIUC, it’s only posted onchain on optimism. I’m actually not sure if EAS supports onchain polygon attestations in their SDK/UI yet… curious to find out. 

That said, there’s got to be a good solution like layerzero or something that will let you look up the state of an attestation across chains. Hopefully someone here has some ideas at 2023-11-19 21:29:44 : replied to :1506

Kristofer said The seed to a project lies buried here 😀. I had a chat with Carl Cervone about this a while back (because of Hypercerts). In order for an attestation to be trustworthy, for it to carry some weight, the source needs to be trustworthy. So, something a bit like Gitcoin Passport but for projects. A attestations based platform where a project can “prove” ownership/control over various assets, initially wallet addresses. Community members / known folks can attest to certain addresses belonging to a project. Additional stamps / attestations can be imagined as well: prove ownership of ENS name, other known project address attests to address, etc. at 2023-11-29 02:48:33 : replied to :1603

Taylor Hill said Honestly brother, I haven't used it, but I see a pattern with certain facets of web2 social media becoming their own protocol in Web3.

Bryce | EAS said Posts are attestations.

A post is just one entity saying something, i.e. they attest to the statement. Many interactions on social media are attestations. When you post, like, follow, repost, set your username, are all just different forms of attestations. at 2023-12-03 06:28:47 : replied to :1643

Kyle Kaplan said Hey guys, I was wondering if I could get more clarity around the EASSCAN explorer and GraphQL API. It says in the docs "we will pin the attestation to IPFS and then index it for the EASSCAN explorer". Doesn't pinning to IPFS cost money? Do you guys pay that for everyone and forever? Same question about the graphql api, is this hosted and paid centrally by you guys? Also, is this meant to be leveraged for production apps to build on top off or just meant to be used by the explorer? at 2023-12-05 23:54:41 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said We currently pay the costs associated with pinning to IPFS (albiet small). Ultimately EAS doesnt presuppose where users will store their offchain attestations and ultimately are hoping users use tools like Ceramic and other methods to distribute public offchain attestations. 

Our infrastructure is also self hosted and currently our apis are meant for development and low to medium volume requests. We open sourced the indexer on our github so anyone can run their own indexer/graphql endpoint at 2023-12-06 00:29:50 : replied to :1692

Danette said Hi, I recently learned about EAS and I have a question about the potential licensing applications. I read the description below on the EAS Wiki. The description references a "simple interface" to verify an EAS enabled license. Can someone please explain what a verifying interface would need to consist of in order to successfully verify an attestation-enabled license? Thanks! 

"To verify a license, the relevant parties could simply access the attestation and verify its authenticity. For example, a business owner applying for a permit could present their license attestation to the relevant authority, who could then verify its authenticity and other details using a simple interface." at 2023-12-07 05:43:50 : replied to :None
Bryce | EAS said In this example, a simple interface would allow the license/permit holder to share their attestation with the entity who is looking to verify it. Whether you make the license offchain or onchain will influence how you design the interface. at 2023-12-07 05:57:23 : replied to :1702
Danette said I plan to make the license onchain. Are there any examples of anyone using an interface to verify onchain attestations currently? at 2023-12-07 06:01:03 : replied to :1703

DOOM bot44 said hi - i just accidentally did the attestation on base, didn't understand the revoke option doesnt do anything about the onchain data.

so to clarify, even if i revoke, the token is still associated with my wallet?

my big concern here is dapps gating/blocking my account by having country of residence on file at 2023-12-07 06:03:30 : replied to :None

DOOM bot44 said just wondering how the process works on chain with how it's coded.

even if i revoke it really doesn't change anything in terms of what's available to dapps? they can still filter based on that token i created? at 2023-12-07 06:06:57 : replied to :None
Danette said Absolutely! happy to discuss. at 2023-12-07 06:12:40 : replied to :1707
Moonid said Revoked attestations should be considered invalid by dapps, but even if that's not good enough, 

This problem is still easily fixed....

Just use a new address. at 2023-12-07 07:04:59 : replied to :1706
Moonid said If your concern is other dapps blocking you based on the country, the solution here is to make a new ETH address and use that one.  

Nobody is forced to only use one ETH address .

If you don't want anyone to see you transfer your funds from your old "verified address" to your "new" one, just send all your funds back to Coinbase, and then withdraw to a new address. at 2023-12-07 07:11:41 : replied to :1709
Moonid said ETH addresses are free to make and can be discarded any time, you don't have to keep and use the same ETH address forever. at 2023-12-07 07:12:48 : replied to :None
Moonid said It's also possible to have one verified address that is used for dapps that require verifications, and other unverified addresses for dapps that don't require them.  

The flexibility is there depending on the use case of the dapp/user at 2023-12-07 07:28:22 : replied to :None
DOOM bot44 said got it :) really appreciate the info!

so if i revoke the attestation, is there a scenario where a dapp can still run a query on past information? i'm reading that it's taken out of the UI upon revoke but still on chain, so i'd imagine that means it's not simple for them to just run it and see past history? at 2023-12-07 12:48:29 : replied to :1711
Leo said My guess is that your tests fail to prefund the address with the test token and you get an arithmetical underflow from when the test token attempts to deduct the amount from the insufficient balance at 2023-12-07 19:04:05 : replied to :1699

Phoeni0x said yeap, but as I am learning how to combine offchain-onchain attestations. I came up with a case where attestations were created offchain and I needed to create another onchain attestation that links this offchain one at 2023-12-07 21:28:07 : replied to :2

Steve Dakh | EAS said Yes, in this case you should add a schema field representing the offchain attestation UID and attest with it. Currently onchain refuid supports only onchain attestations (we may change this in the future), but you can still accomplish a reference to the offchain attestation using this method. at 2023-12-07 21:30:38 : replied to :1722

DOOM bot44 said thankfully was finally able to send the revoke - looks like it's the exact same tx in the easscan, just says "revoked"

so it's got an invalid flag, but technically anyone can scan the attestation, see i was registered under a certain country without a replacement and still block access? i mean it's decentralized and public so they can do whatever they want - was just surprised there was no change to the tx URL other than the red "This attestation was revoked"

Vigan Abdurrahmani said hi there, I was exploring off chain attestations and wondered if I make an attestation via sdk will it still appear on explorer? or in this case should I implement storing and sharing logic myself? at 2023-12-12 02:51:06 : replied to :None
Bryce | EAS said EAS doesn’t presuppose where offchain attestations should be stored. You can store it locally, passed peer to peer in browsers, as a QR code, in AWS, decentralized storage, wherever.

If you publish it to IPFS though the attestation explorer to make it public, well then index it and display it. But by default, they are private and can be stored wherever. at 2023-12-12 02:54:35 : replied to :None

Danette said Question: could EAS potentially be used to replace affiliate links to help track sales in a decentralized landscape?  I’m throwing out ideas that might help with a problem I’m trying to solve. My goal is to keep customer sales tied to me when I bring them to a platform or product and I’m wondering if EAS can help in that endeavor. Any thoughts? at 2023-12-20 00:55:06 : replied to :2
Bryce | EAS said Yes this is a possiblity! Probably good to focus on one specific product/purchase type and expand from there. But here's some napkin ideas of how it could work:

1- Create a registry of affiliates by attesting to the wallet addresses. Each attestation is assigned a UID and would include affliate terms, etc.

2- Generate the affiliate URL leveraging the UID of the affiliate. You’d have to setup your own tracking for link clicks etc.

3- If the user completes a purchase, you could generate another attestation as a receipt. It could include things like the product id, purchase amt, etc) and reference the UID of the affiliate.

4- Once the receipt and affiliate are verified, you can reward based on the affiliate terms.

5- This could be done onchain/offchain. at 2023-12-20 01:45:52 : replied to :1874
Danette said Thank you! I’ll ideate on this some more. 

One hurdle I’m trying to solve in conjunction is preventing the product manufacturer from bypassing me and the work I’ve done to bring in the customer by selling directly to the customer and not going thru my attestation/affiliate link thereby cutting me out of the reward after I did the work to bring them in.

DinN said Hi there! I'm interested in the EAS concept and have been looking into the documentation. However, there are some parts that I'm struggling to understand, particularly its similarity to DID. I'm curious about what advantages EAS has over DID.

1. EAS and DID seem to have almost identical logic. What are the differences? I'm interested in knowing what aspects make EAS feasible where DID might have limitations.

2. Is it possible for EAS to act as an intermediary for various companies' DIDs, integrating multiple DIDs into a single EAS? at 2023-12-20 06:24:48 : replied to :2

Steve Dakh | EAS said Imagine a seller wants to sell something, they attest to the item they want to sell. A potential buyer can attest that they are willing to buy it by referencing the initial attestation. The seller can make a confirmation attestation if they are willing to sell it to the buyer. 

After the receipt of the item the buyer and seller can attest to the success of the transaction including any comments if wanted. 

If there’s a dispute, a negative rating can be attested. 

This creates a digital paper trail of the entire transaction. It can be done onchain or even completely offchain. at 2024-01-07 11:55:08 : replied to :1941

Sven said Hey all, I am working on a project for certification of valuable assets. We are working with law enforcement and insurance companies on a number of topics, one of them being theft. Now before i knew about EAS I put this topic ion the backlog, but there;s so much already built by you guys I might be able to launch a version that deals with theft status quite quickly. New problem is there's so many possibilities I am now not sure how to go about it. Is there some example you may have worked out that deals with something similar? at 2024-01-08 21:44:48 : replied to :1848
Sven said I can go into my usecase with more details, but to prevent pollution I'll sum it up: owner has a certified product (let's say an expensive bike) which has a serial number, and is registered on-chain as being produced by bike company BikeX. (ownership is not handled on-chain). Now at some point, this bike is stolen. The legal owner can submit an attestation of that event, possibly the police station can attest to this as well. If someone happens to check the serial number on-line somewhere, they can see the bike has been reported stolen. If the police has attested to theft, they should contact them to return the bike (or have the status revoked). at 2024-01-08 21:48:49 : replied to :1848
Sven said how would that translate to schema's? Is the "theft" event a different schema to the "certified product" schema? Would the bike-ID be just a parameter in the schema or is there a smarter way to link attestations to a specific object? at 2024-01-08 21:51:28 : replied to :1848
Bryce | EAS said Hey! Great use case btw. You're on the right track. There would be several schemas used in this example.

-Attesting to the authenticity of the product (i.e. bike with serial number). Once this is registered it ges its own attestation UID, which can be used as a reference in future attestations.

- A theft schema (attesting the bike is stolen as true and perhaps a hash of some evidence, or more details about the event). This schema would attest and reference the bike UID.

- You can also include a schema for ownership (attesting to who the owner is) and subsequently the transfer of ownership (revoking the previous owner and attesting to a new address that is the rightful owner) if the bike is ever sold. at 2024-01-08 22:17:35 : replied to :1953

Afo Wefa said Yea I’ve explored that and it works, I guess my wish is DiDs are treated at the same level of addresses as they seem to be the best identifier that works both on and off chain along with connecting the Web2 and Web3 worlds.

Is the belief that addresses are the best source for identity? My concern with addresses are security and lack of anonymity. Some of the security issues are being addressed with account abstraction though still doesn’t cover anonymity. at 2024-01-25 07:53:45 : replied to :2067

seanwbren.eth said Oh cool and I see the EAS explorer has the referenced by link on the original. Will go with that! at 2024-01-26 02:10:01 : replied to :2
Afo Wefa said That works in the use cases where you want the action and anonymity private. I’m thinking around having the action public and retaining anonymity. 

You can do this at a schema level and leave the recipient blank as a workaround which is fine. It makes aggregation a little more difficult especially if you nest DIDs in multiple schemas then you need your own registry on or off chain to aggregate. 

This can be solved on the address side with AA and I’m guessing map a smart account address with no transactions to a DiD. at 2024-01-26 03:26:07 : replied to :2072
seanwbren.eth said Reading the docs and two questions now. 
With #9 modular schemas, I'm thinking I can have a core schema and then a "farcaster stats" schema that references it. 
And for #10, the inherent and optional recipient address, does that mean I don't need to include a userAddress field in the schema if the recipientAddress is the same thing? at 2024-01-26 03:55:35 : replied to :2078

Andrew Hong (ilemi) said How do people name their schemas? at 2024-02-01 01:52:55 : replied to :2196
Steve Dakh | EAS said The best way to start is that your schema should be descriptive enough that it shouldn’t need a name. For example “bytes32 bookReadUID” or “bool hasVisitedTheMoon”. 

As many schemas are meant to be reusable, naming a schema directly can create problems with this. We are working on a new way to show display names for schemas to replace the current way. at 2024-02-01 02:01:14 : replied to :2199

Gene Davis said Hello all. I'm Gene. I am looking to either form or join a team to apply for the upcoming fellowship program. I've contributed to several DAOs in the past like the TEC, Gitcoin, and presently on a council within Optimism. I have several ideas for projects, but am also happy to try and develop other's concepts. One idea, that is general but I can narrow for my use case, would be an extremely simple version of a relative trust network using a variably-private data attestation market. Another idea, something very specific but could be generalized, is a commodity delivery/market-making service, presently specifically focused on the grain exchange in Nigeria. I have a friend there that I am trying to help and this could be an interesting disruptive angle to a traditional non-crypto market or a path towards a later broader generalization. Just a couple of ideas I've been bouncing around to myself the last few days. Would be delighted to discuss anything with anyone. Thanks in advance for reading this and being part of this community.

Bryce | EAS said Hi Danny, thanks for being a supporter of EAS. 

1) The Fellowship program has mentors from the across the ecosystem (it's not specific to investor types, there are engineers, product people, ecosystem leaders, etc). The object of participants is to build something of value and sustainable with attestations.
2) No cost for the program, just time. 
3) No capital is exchanged or promised through the program. Its a way to get attestation specific product support and pitch in front of ecosystem partners that could help you scale your vision.
4) The primary timezone will center around EST. However, we will be mindful of all participants/teams to make sure its inclusive. 

LMK if this helps! Happy to jump on a chat as well if thats helpful. at 2024-02-06 03:53:56 : replied to :2234
Gattman | Sherlock said Thank you for the quick reply.

Rich said Hi there, I'm trying to get my head around how Attestations could be used for an account opening use case across multiple online shops/merchants - the use case is that instead of a user having to complete forms for each shop/merchant, the user could sign-up (and be attested) with the first shop/merchant and then when the user wants to sign up with a 2nd/3rd/4th shop/merchant, they could just generate a proof to the new merchant and then be fast-tracked through the sign-up process at 2024-02-09 05:26:02 : replied to :2

encrypted8532 | mihir said I have a quick question,
1) If an off-chain attestation is public, does that mean the data of attestation is also public?
And if we make it private is it not indexed or is it also encrypted?
2) are off-chain attestation indexed by EAS indexer when they are public? at 2024-02-10 11:47:33 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said The public eas graph endpoint doesn’t index the decoded data, however you may still be able to match it using a string search. Alternatively you can run your own graph/indexer and index the fields you want at 2024-02-10 19:09:45 : replied to :2279
Steve Dakh | EAS said The sdk readme should have some examples you can run. There’s nothing specific to nodejs vs front end in regards to sdk at 2024-02-10 19:10:58 : replied to :2282
Steve Dakh | EAS said When an offchain attestation shows “public” on easscan it just means that we have stored it in our indexer and published to IPFS. 

If it’s not published then no one has it except the user who created it. It can be shared on a need to know basis or encrypted. at 2024-02-10 19:13:08 : replied to :2286

Danette said qDAO? at 2024-02-11 04:40:02 : replied to :2273
Dan said quality Daily Active User = qDAU. Recognizing that bots are all around us, particularly in crypto, product teams need to find ways to measure the signal while filtering out the noise. That's what qDAU is supposed to represent- the "One Metric That Matters" for a consumer product.

This is also a sort of use case that attestations, specifically using trust networks, is really ideal to solve, hence why we are experimenting with applications using them at 2024-02-11 08:00:31 : replied to :2297

I want to build a system to verify the sports match results.
In that system the referee will attest to the results of the match.

Dan said I think this use case could be accomplished much more simply with a single schema for thefts. 

It could be along the lines of isStolen (boolean), identifier (string), an optional identifier description (string), an optional type (string), and an optional context field (string) for additional data (whether plaintext or hashed/encrypted)

As long as the identifiers are searchable in some UI somewhere, it would be fairly easy to retrieve the attestations about stolenness. Verification could simply be to use the isTrue schema and reference the isStolen attestation UID if the attestation comes from an individual at 2024-02-13 22:33:21 : replied to :1954
Steve Dakh | EAS said You can use this to fix this issue:

seanwbren.eth said 1) Are there tricks to "solidity gas golf" with creating a schema? 
With 6 fields (2 uint32, 4 strings) each attestation is 45 cents on Base mainnet which is higher than expected. Likely will use Base Sepolia instead in the short term, and then the Ceramic offchain storage at 2024-02-14 02:11:06 : replied to :2

Dave H said Sure! I want to focus on one of the US states. Each state keeps a database of licensed professionals, and I know that for engineering, you would have to pass a PE exam, and then apply for the license by having other licensed professionals attest to your skills and experience. All of that amounts to collecting references and paperwork, which takes months to process. 
We can speed that up by having the state government + licensed professionals make attestations when onboarding new engineers/lawyers/doctors/etc. Each US state has their own systems as well, so its tough sometimes to practice a profession between states. I think all of that could be made much smoother with EAS. I have to work out most of the details though, and we'll start small of course. at 2024-02-19 04:57:43 : replied to :2382

The primary challenge for this use case and others like it is not tech implementation - but getting gov't to accept new tech.

Steve Dakh | EAS said Technically you can make offchain attestations with schemas that don’t exist onchain, however when someone tries to load that offchain attestation into our front end explorer it will fail to validate in the browser if the schema cannot be found. 

This doesn’t mean the offchain attestation is invalid. You can build a UI which decodes and displays these types of attestations nicely. at 2024-02-19 23:38:30 : replied to :2394

Steve Dakh | EAS said If you have to you can technically deploy the EAS contracts on that chain. However, in the future we may deploy an official version. Which chain are you looking to implement? at 2024-02-23 22:12:22 : replied to :2422
Steve Dakh | EAS said 1. You can also pin the attestations yourself. Ultimately, It will become infeasible for us to index an infinitely growing number of offchain attestations and we are working on some interesting solutions for a global offchain storage. This is where ceramic is good. 

2. EASScan doesnt automatically index ceramic stored attestations. With ceramic, you typically push the data to a ceramic node and anyone can connect to it p2p and pull attestations from it. at 2024-02-23 22:19:01 : replied to :2423

Offchain attestations still have the authenticity of the eip712 digital signature and can be stored anywhere (locally, ipfs, aws, etc). at 2024-02-26 00:57:40 : replied to :2459
Bryce | EAS said You can timestamp the offchain attestation UID onchain to give it provenance, or use a timestamping service like Witness. at 2024-02-26 00:57:51 : replied to :2461

Steve Dakh | EAS said We don’t actually presuppose how you decide to encode your data, however the EAS schema decoder right now only supports EVM standard types. There are no undefined types in solidity so it would not decode properly in the SDK or the explorer.  

You can optionally choose to encode the data however you want and write your own encoding/decoding tools and UX at 2024-02-27 19:07:46 : replied to :2472
Kristofer said ['Thanks, using the std decoder is nice, I’ll just do a string instead, that also improves readability. It’s for Hypercerts evaluations.

Steve Dakh | EAS said For three states a uint8 field would be best and use 0, 1, or 2 as your states. Alternatively use a bytes32 field instead of a string as it would use half as much storage at 2024-02-27 19:14:16 : replied to :2477
Steve Dakh | EAS said You can encode up to 32 chars into a bytes32 field at 2024-02-27 19:15:16 : replied to :2
Kristofer said Yeah, but no fun for someone who is reading the attestation in the explorer. Sometimes it is worth trading optimisation for readability. 

Hmm. bytes32.. perhaps. Nice. 

I’ll give it some thought. at 2024-02-27 19:16:23 : replied to :2478

DLFDL 2020 said Can you please tell me which EAS SDK request is for fetching all attestations? Or is this possible only using graphql? at 2024-02-27 21:46:08 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said EAS by default doesn’t index attestations onchain. You can use the graphql endpoint or run your own indexer. If you require onchain indexing you can use the EASindexer contract to index and query attestations by schema id and attester/recipient at 2024-02-27 22:42:28 : replied to :2482

We are researching about Attestations to be included in the follow-up of our programs, and we found out EAS is the best option by far.
Is there any existing scheme related to education that I can look at?

Jack 235 said ['We are working on an artist registry (', {'type': 'link', 'text': 'registry.rc.xyz'}, '), and one of the first issues we will address is the attestation of artist wallets, as artists are often represented by multiple wallets. There are several approaches to consider:Utilizing one primary wallet with only one-way attestation. This method can be problematic because artists might attest to wallets not in their possession. For example, when an artist adds a fourth wallet, it would only require one attestation.Employing one primary wallet with two-way attestation, meaning each wallet added needs to be attested by both the primary wallet and the newly added wallet. This method prevents the addition of uncontrollable wallets but still relies on a primary wallet, which can be lost or forgotten. In this scenario, adding a fourth wallet would necessitate two attestations.Avoiding a main wallet altogether and requiring the newly added wallet to be attested by all existing wallets creates a network without a central point of failure. However, this approach means that adding a fourth wallet would require four attestations, which could be cumbersome.We are eager to hear the thoughts of the EAS team. For instance, Meme 6529 profiles opt for approach 3 (as shown in the picture), but this system limits users to a maximum of three wallets (one for mints, one hot, and one vault), which can be restrictive, especially for artists who operate across multiple blockchains.'] at 2024-02-29 03:39:36 : replied to :None

Steve Dakh | EAS said EAS is a protocol for making onchain and offchain attestations. It doesn’t presuppose how entities will choose to share their proofs. You could share the proofs manually using the private data attestation UX or you could build a tool that handles p2p messaging of proofs at 2024-03-04 21:05:46 : replied to :2593
None said It's not about that "sharing". It's about recipient-only proof. at 2024-03-04 21:17:41 : replied to :2
None said Say I attest a fact to you in private manner. I can send you parts of the proof (leaves) to verify. But I only want that stay between us at 2024-03-04 21:21:14 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said If you give a proof of a leaf to someone they can share the leaf and the proof with anyone. at 2024-03-04 21:21:17 : replied to :2603
Steve Dakh | EAS said You can’t prohibit someone from sharing a proof at 2024-03-04 21:21:35 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said You could privately share leaves and proofs. Obviously you’d have to rely on them not revealing it. The rest of the leaves would still be completely unknown. at 2024-03-04 21:22:31 : replied to :2

Steve Dakh | EAS said You can create different salt per recipient at 2024-03-04 22:29:06 : replied to :2615
None said Say,
I got the issuer as the university to privately attest my academic summary. At this point, a salt has been chosen.

I can choose to reveal a proof for “C- in PE” for someone but I don’t want them to broadcast it to everyone. Now it’s easy to know if my score is published, the actor is that guy no doubt.

Imagine I share the same proof to 3 people, when it’s exposed, who am I gonna blame? at 2024-03-04 22:54:33 : replied to :2
None said Given the nature of current private attestation, it’s impossible to generate proof with verifier as a parameter.

I think we can explore that as a better mode of private attestation before we move to truly ZKP. at 2024-03-04 22:56:22 : replied to :2
None said Right now proof generation takes leaf index only because that’s how we construct the initial leaf and the merkle tree. at 2024-03-04 22:57:17 : replied to :2
None said How to derive proofs using both the fact and the expected verifier is what I’m looking for at 2024-03-04 22:59:54 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said You can create redundant leaves of the same data (hundreds even for each piece) and each piece have its own seed. You could then maintain a mapping of who has each piece. at 2024-03-04 23:01:32 : replied to :2

RyGuy said hey all - I have a question regarding resolver contracts

If I wanted to implement a resolver contract that checked for multiple true critiera (such as, only a specific person can attest, it mints an NFT, and the recipient receives 10 USDC) when attesting, would it be better to have all these criteria in a single resolver contract or can one attest schema utilize multiple resolver contracts for every attestation made against it at 2024-03-05 04:06:55 : replied to :2
Leo said Using a single resolver will be much cheaper in gas, but in any case currently we only support a single resolver per-schema at 2024-03-05 04:11:30 : replied to :2631

Last year most people never even heard of attestations. This year, we had so many teams come up to us we never knew about who are building on EAS and saw countless presentations mention attestations as a core primitive.

Robert Casrrillon said Hey everyone, We're exploring the potential of EAS to positively impact the agricultural sector, particularly focusing on improving the quality of life for Colombian farmers. Given EAS's capabilities for creating and managing digital credentials, I'm keen to hear your thoughts on how this technology could be applied to:

- Promote transparency and traceability in the supply chain of agricultural products, including their ethical sourcing.
- Facilitate access to fair markets and equitable prices for farmers' products.
- Improve access to financing and government aid programs through verifiable digital identities.

How do you see the applicability and potential impact of EAS in these areas within the Colombian context, especially considering the socioeconomic challenges faced by farming families? I appreciate your insights and suggestions in advance. at 2024-03-06 22:42:27 : replied to :None
Bryce | EAS said Setting "context" is simply a referenced attestation to the schema UID. We then display it in the explorer UI if the context came from the same creator address of the schema. at 2024-03-06 22:43:57 : replied to :2
amanwithwings said hey Bryce! I'm finalizing the attestation standard for DAOs and we need each schema to set a context. The question above is about validation - I understand that context will show up on the explorer UI, but how do I automatically validate it on my end? Do I check if schema owner has made a  valid attestation using 0xcc6c9b07bfccd15c8f313d23bf4389fb75629a620c5fa669c898bf1e023f2508, referencing their schema? at 2024-03-06 23:45:20 : replied to :2673
Bryce | EAS said Yes, not every schema will have a context set as we did not want to force that into the protocol itself. If you require that each schema used in your standard has "context" defined, then you would listen for attestations made with schema uid (0xcc6c9b07bfccd15c8f313d23bf4389fb75629a620c5fa669c898bf1e023f2508) that references the UID of their schema. You could also look for a specific address you trust that attests the context (it doesn't need to be the creator address). at 2024-03-07 00:44:45 : replied to :2

I agree, current setup is not sustainable, and it should not be the reponsibility of EAS to index attestations for _all_ projects.

Leo said Anyway, ttyl at 2024-03-09 18:28:53 : replied to :2
Leo said ["So basically we support two approaches for delegated transactions. The first approach is the more standard EIP712 approach involving nonce management. I think that this approach isn't a good fit for you, since it requires to manage and cache nonces for your users. The contract expects incremental nonces and older nonces are immediately invalidated. For example, imagine that the contract expect nonce 5 and you creates 3 signatures with nonce 5, 6, and 7: you have to submit the signatures in the correct order (nonce 7 won't be accepted as long as nonce 5 wasn't sent, etc.) and if your user created other signatures with these nonces - they will no longer work, etc.The more suitable approach is to use an EIP712Proxy that we have deployed almost everywhere. You need to use the ", {'type': 'code', 'text': 'getEIP712Proxy()'}, ' and the ', {'type': 'code', 'text': 'attestByDelegationProxy'}, " API. This contracts implements an alternative to the nonce management which doesn't require you to send any nonces at all.In both cases, you should work with the most updated SDK version, since it takes into account all the different deployments and backward compatibility issues."] at 2024-03-09 19:56:06 : replied to :2746
Leo said The EIP712Proxy approach has other tradeoffs (for example, if your user signs 5 signatures - all will work, which might not have been what he intended), which in some cases are preferable and sometimes are not at 2024-03-09 19:56:56 : replied to :2
Leo said But, as far as I understand your goals, it's still the best approach for you at 2024-03-09 19:57:21 : replied to :2

We are considering using attestations to transfer data from meters directly to the blockchain. The meters have a public and private key and can sign transactions. Now the idea is to record DeviceId and Public Key in L1 attestations to have a reliable global source of truth. And record the metrics in the L2 attestation for cost-effectiveness. Is it possible to link L2 attestation with data to L1 attestation with public key and DeviceId? at 2024-03-11 22:31:11 : replied to :None

If you can let all applicants know the outcome then that would be appreciated. That way all unsuccessful applicants can have closure, and move on. Thanks in advance if this can be accommodated, cheers. at 2024-03-13 08:26:57 : replied to :2798

Arthur_1819 said Hi Bryce, 

I recently signed up for a live, but online Bootcamp that is being held by Chainlink. Note: I have never been involved with Chainlink, but this free course sounded to good to pass up.
So, for 'early builders' a free, live, but online Bootcamp run by the EAS team, with content focussed around using EAS, might get get these new builders building faster with EAS? And attract people to EAS who haven't interacted before, similar to my case with Chainlink?

Secondly, for the 'mature builders' regular, online hackathons might be an equivalent program to focus the mind & get builders building faster with EAS. You may have noticed too, but the EAS Telegram Channels seem to really light up during ETHDenver when they were having their hackathon. I.e. There was a lot of activity on Telegram as people were building with EAS during the hackathon. So perhaps you could hold remote hackathons on a regular basis and require all projects be EAS related?

That's my quick two cents! at 2024-03-15 08:04:31 : replied to :2840

For #2, we intend to be more active this year with lots of builder programs! A specific EAS hackathon is something we're exploring O.o at 2024-03-16 03:31:35 : replied to :2841
Arthur_1819 said Hi Bryce, thanks for the reply & encouragement. I'm happy for you to DM me, but the Chainlink program is still to occur, as it runs from the 2nd to 14th April. I can send you feedback about the course then, if you'd like, around the 14th to 16th. But overall, right now, I can't provide details.

But yes, onboarding sessions sound good!
In my current industry: Every prospective supplier who wants us to learn and use their tech (I know EAS isn't a 'supplier', but the goal of 'onboarding users and getting them to engage with our tech as much as possible' might lead to similarities) would routinely run webinars. E.g. "Do this in your industry better using our software! And in this webinar we'll show you how to do xyz with [our software], instead of doing it the old way" or "Get started with [our software]! In this webinar we'll show you how to setup an account and start performing basic xyz functions".
My current industry is accounting & bookkeeping, and there are lots of tech businesses who want to be added to a firm tech stack. So, it may not be as applicable to EAS and web3. But again, just adding my, personal two cents since you mentioned onboarding sessions. at 2024-03-16 08:04:17 : replied to :2846

Mo said Hi!

Quick question, im integrating the SDK to issue multiple credentials at once

All works well with normal meta mask

I’d like to also do this with gnosis safe. Are there any examples for this? I’d somehow need to generate the transaction data rather than directly call the multi attest method at 2024-03-20 07:06:59 : replied to :2
Leo said We do have foundry.toml with all the dependencies. Alternatively, you can add OZ to your foundry.toml at 2024-03-20 07:12:51 : replied to :2881
Leo said Every call already returns a tx object you don’t have to broadcast (by calling wait()) and you can use its data explicitly at 2024-03-20 07:14:51 : replied to :2882
Mo said Noted, so multi attest prepares the transaction content, but it’s never actually broadcast till I call wait

So I can just call the method, and pass the raw output as a gnosis transaction I’m preparing? at 2024-03-20 07:23:11 : replied to :2884

Mo said Awesome thanks, I ended up created a homegrown method earlier that calls the exact same “populate transaction” logic so I could feed that to gnosis safe (especially as signer may not be the current wallet, but an EOA which is a signer on the safe)

Quick question, I saw you’re creating the transaction.
Is it possible to sign without broadcasting in the case of metamask?

Today when experimenting, I ran into an issue where it turns out they’ve explicitly removed this capability, as it messed with their nonces at 2024-03-21 09:32:53 : replied to :2912

Cifer said const newAttestationUID = await tx.wait()

This above function is meant to return the ID of the attestation that was made on chain right?

Instead it throws an error saying receipt.confirmations is not a function at ContractTransactionResponse.wait at 2024-03-27 03:41:22 : replied to :2

Cifer said Something i think you should know is that I am not directly using ethers provider. You might see the import there but it's not in use. 

I am using Privy to expose an ethers provider.

Then i go ahead and use the provider / signer to make my attestations at 2024-03-27 04:01:42 : replied to :2

Cifer said ['@L ', {'type': 'mention', 'text': '@stevedakh'}, ' I need some help please'] at 2024-03-30 17:19:41 : replied to :2
Cifer said I am using a paymaster to handle gas for attestations and because of that i can't use the eas.attest() so what i am doing instead is to populate the transaction using contractInstance.attest.populateTransaction(struct) at 2024-03-30 17:21:41 : replied to :2
Cifer said Now because of this, the UID that is meant to be returned when using eas.attest() isn't being returned. What comes back is the transaction receipt from the paymaster at 2024-03-30 17:22:30 : replied to :2
Cifer said Do yoy know of any way I can get the UID as well? at 2024-03-30 17:22:43 : replied to :2
Leo said I’m not familiar with paymaster, but the SDK extracts the UID from the events in the receipt, so if an attestation happened, it should have worked. 

Do you have an example of such a tx? at 2024-03-30 20:12:40 : replied to :2
Cifer said Yes i do, i can send a screenshot or perhaps a github gist containing my code at 2024-03-30 20:25:20 : replied to :2
Cifer said Which do you prefer? at 2024-03-30 20:25:24 : replied to :2
Cifer said The thing is, instead of doing eas.attest() like the sdk has it

I am doing contractInstance.attest.populateTransaction() at 2024-03-30 20:27:36 : replied to :2
Cifer said populateTransaction takes in the schema and data at 2024-03-30 20:27:54 : replied to :2
Cifer said Then the data is an object that contains the recipient, expiration date, refUID, etc... at 2024-03-30 20:28:38 : replied to :2
Cifer said I have to do it this way because of the paymaster, and what returns is a transaction receipt for a successful attestation at 2024-03-30 20:29:34 : replied to :2
Cifer said And this receipt that gets returned doesn't contain the attestation UID at 2024-03-30 20:30:04 : replied to :2
Leo said It should in its “events/logs” field at 2024-03-30 20:35:24 : replied to :3055

Leo said You are sending transaction A to paymaster. You think that it also attests, but it might be attesting using other transaction B at 2024-03-31 00:33:18 : replied to :2
Leo said So I'm asking to check A first at 2024-03-31 00:33:24 : replied to :2
Leo said Is this the transaction you are sending to paymaster? at 2024-03-31 00:33:42 : replied to :3091
Leo said Or the tx of the attestation? at 2024-03-31 00:33:47 : replied to :2

Leo said Everything else is a distraction at 2024-03-31 00:33:57 : replied to :2

Leo said What network? at 2024-03-31 00:34:42 : replied to :2
Cifer said Umm, I'm lost with this. You mean the paymaster actually creates a copy transaction and uses it to make the attestation and returns a receipt to me? at 2024-03-31 00:35:33 : replied to :3092
Leo said Not necessary a copy transaction at 2024-03-31 00:35:44 : replied to :2
Leo said But you transaction A "submits" the request and its backend later sends an actual transaction B at 2024-03-31 00:36:03 : replied to :2

Leo said If this is what happens, we can't really help you at 2024-03-31 00:36:17 : replied to :2
Leo said But in order to verify, I'm asking you to send the tx that you are sending to it at 2024-03-31 00:36:30 : replied to :2
Leo said We don't have the capacity to do a deep dive into paymaster and understand how it works at 2024-03-31 00:37:05 : replied to :2
Leo said Please check if there are "Attested" events in the transaction that you are submitting to it at 2024-03-31 00:37:34 : replied to :2
Leo said Using etherscan at 2024-03-31 00:37:41 : replied to :2
Leo said If you don't see it, it means that the attestation is actually done by another means at 2024-03-31 00:37:56 : replied to :2
Leo said And you need to get the actual transaction that attests from paymaster and use our API to get the UID at 2024-03-31 00:38:13 : replied to :2
Leo said I can't help you more than that :( at 2024-03-31 00:38:22 : replied to :2

Leo said 🙏🙏 at 2024-03-31 00:39:08 : replied to :2
Cifer said Let's go back to this, because it seems I can't get the UID so i would need another means of fetching an attestation. Is there any other way? no matter how complex it is at 2024-03-31 00:42:57 : replied to :3081
Leo said You can only fetch it from the actual tx that attested to it at 2024-03-31 00:44:25 : replied to :2
Leo said Please please please please send the tx that you are submitting to paymaster 🙏🙏🙏 at 2024-03-31 00:44:35 : replied to :2
Leo said This is the only way to verify if it attests or not at 2024-03-31 00:44:43 : replied to :2
Leo said If it only "submits" it to paymaster and doesn't actually attest - you need to find a way to get the actual attesting txs and run it through our API at 2024-03-31 00:45:09 : replied to :2
Leo said We can't do more than that at this point at 2024-03-31 00:45:16 : replied to :2

Maxime Servais said Hey everyone,

Wanted to pick your brain if you have a few minutes to spare. I am planning to build an onchain review system on top of EAS and would like to use the Farcaster social graph at some point + warpcast frames.

I am trying to decide what 'stack' I should use and I am super confused by all the options. Even simply choosing a wallet login library or provider is super overwhelming 😅

I want to launch a prototype ASAP so was thinking of using some kind of Web3 Infra provider like Thirdweb or Alchemy or Privy.

Anyone has any recommendations of what works well with EAS & Farcaster?

Maxime Servais said Hey everyone, can I make an offchain attestation and then reference it in an onchain attestation in refUID? When I try to do that it on OP Sepolia, it doesn't work. If both attestations are offchain or both onchain, then it works fine at 2024-04-09 19:59:38 : replied to :2
Leo said No, onchain refUID must reference an attestation that exists onchain at 2024-04-09 20:02:59 : replied to :3274
Leo said We are exploring different referencing strategies for future versions at 2024-04-09 20:03:39 : replied to :2
Maxime Servais said Ah, damn... My goal is to minimize what we store onchain, preferring instead to link to offchain data. What's the recommended way to reference an onchain attestation to an offchain one? at 2024-04-09 20:09:37 : replied to :2
Maxime Servais said ['Add a ', {'type': 'bold', 'text': 'bytes32'}, ' hash field to the onchain schema? And when attesting, make sure to reference the offchain attestation UID in that field?'] at 2024-04-09 20:10:15 : replied to :2
Leo said Yeah, this is a great solution using the current version at 2024-04-09 20:10:47 : replied to :3278
Leo said But I’ve noted your feedback in any case 🙏 at 2024-04-09 20:11:01 : replied to :2
Maxime Servais said Let’s say there’s a form on the frontend for users to fill out. Behind the scenes, we're looking at two attestations: one stored offchain and one onchain. This setup seems like it would require users to sign off on two separate transactions, right? And if I'm getting this right, we'd need to complete the offchain attestation first to get the hash, which we would then include in the onchain attestation. So users would have to wait for the offchain attestation to be hashed and stored before they can proceed with the onchain transaction? at 2024-04-09 20:16:16 : replied to :2
Maxime Servais said ['(more context here: ', {'type': 'link', 'text': 'https://forum.attest.sh/t/schema-for-reviewing-apps/63'}, "). I'm still trying to wrap my head around the best way to nail down the schema, and make the call between onchain vs offchain storage. Keeping everything onchain would no doubt make things straightforward, but then we hit the wall of high costs when we start dealing with text inputs from users."] at 2024-04-09 20:28:02 : replied to :2
Leo said Offchain attestation is only a signature at 2024-04-09 20:40:21 : replied to :3281
Leo said It’s unrelated to how you want to store it at 2024-04-09 20:40:33 : replied to :2
Leo said So you can let the use the sign and then transact right away at 2024-04-09 20:40:56 : replied to :2
Leo said The UID of the offchain attestation is available immediately at 2024-04-09 20:41:13 : replied to :2
Maxime Servais said That makes sense, thank you! So there would be no delay but users would still have to sign two tx (one for the offchain attestation and one for the onchain attestation where they pay gas fees) at 2024-04-09 20:44:58 : replied to :2
None said Yes because they are two different things. at 2024-04-09 20:51:36 : replied to :3287

Theodore Roosevelt said Do you guys have some tutorials on how to do an offchain attestation by doing the EIP 712 signing manually? aka without requiring a browser wallet at 2024-04-17 23:09:49 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said You can follow the sdk examples and use a private key directly at 2024-04-18 00:02:44 : replied to :3482
Theodore Roosevelt said Is there a way you can do the signing yourself without needing to use the private key. Say we have an api that abstracts away posession of a private key. This api request body requires just a message and then it signs that message using a stored private key. Is there a way we can retrieve the offchain message then take that and sign it ourselves using eip 712? at 2024-04-18 00:09:01 : replied to :3483
Steve Dakh | EAS said Yes you can make offchain attestations from a server key for sure. The data can be received via api at 2024-04-18 00:09:58 : replied to :3484

What is the ', {'type': 'italic', 'text': 'best foot forward approach'}, ' with each project?thanks in adv!'] at 2024-04-24 18:03:53 : replied to :2
Carl said First, start by figuring out what you want the attestations to contain and when in your supply chain these attestations will happen. Try to model the data as much as possible beforehand.

Next, go to EAS scan for some testnet and create a schema. You can also write nodejs scripts to create these schemas but for testnets I usually just use the UI.

Do you want specific things to happen when attestations are made or revoked? You can write solidity contracts that do things when this happens.

The EAS documentation is really well written and contains a lot of information.

Sounds like a cool project! How can we keep updated about it? at 2024-04-24 18:27:23 : replied to :3559

Bryce | EAS said Everyone’s attesting in their own ways for specific use cases. This creates never-ending fragmentation without a common standard. Imagine if every email provider created their own “email” protocol. We’d have fmail, dmail, and the list would go on. Instead of people building apps (gmail, outlook, aol). It wouldn’t be as interoperable as it is today. 

Similarly, EAS is an open standard for making attestations about anything. It’s a base primitive so devs don’t have to learn a new protocol every time someone makes a use case specific attestation. at 2024-04-29 06:19:14 : replied to :3585

I'm building an open reputation system for protocols (and all dapps) (not for user reputation), and I've always had AES in the back of my mind for some aspects, particularly highly regarded user atttestations of protocol ligitimacy.
Now im realising AES can also be used in a way for DA, to storge data in a verifiable manner, about reputation state.

urban said Hey guys! We’re building on top of EAS on a contract level. I have a question: is there a way we can call the attest function and preserve the msg.sender so the value is actually the original caller of the transaction? We want the from field of each issued atteststio to be the user who attested instead of our contract. Delegatecall cannot be used due to storage and context limitation. at 2024-05-17 22:08:15 : replied to :2
urban said Our current solution is to include a specific fromUser field in our schema which will exist alongside the original from field. at 2024-05-17 22:09:53 : replied to :2
urban said Are there any good practices trying to achieve this? at 2024-05-17 22:10:11 : replied to :2
JamesCarnley.eth said I've tried a bit but am spinning my wheels so I figured I'd ask a really noob question here:
How do I access the EAS indexer from the SDK?
It seems like it's only exporting the two main contracts and a few other minor objects. I could theoretically just interact with the indexer contract itself but Id rather do it the official way. at 2024-05-18 02:00:12 : replied to :2
Bertrand Juglas | Arthera Integration Engineer said That's what I verified by deploying on Arthera Testnet and now we are looking to deploy on Arthera Mainnet. at 2024-05-18 02:03:37 : replied to :3709
Leo said There’s an Indexer object you can and retrieve from the EAS instance at 2024-05-18 03:07:53 : replied to :3717
Steve Dakh | EAS said Use the graphql endpoints to query the indexer or you can deploy your own. You can also use the onchain indexer contract to index and query onchain at 2024-05-18 03:11:24 : replied to :3717
Leo said Ah, we have two “indexers” 😅 at 2024-05-18 03:13:55 : replied to :2
JamesCarnley.eth said I'm starting to come to terms with GraphQL being the only real way for users or apps to interact with EAS which is unfortunate. Onchain usage is basically just get(id) and set(id, data).
Will the easscan endpoints continue to be free? Are there any decentralized graph endpoints? at 2024-05-18 03:16:13 : replied to :2
Steve Dakh | EAS said As said, for attestations that need to be indexed onchain we have an indexer contract that lets you index and query by attester/recipient/schemaId. Most apps don’t actually need onchain indexing as contracts only need to verify an attestation is valid. at 2024-05-18 03:24:15 : replied to :3722
Steve Dakh | EAS said Easscan endpoints will continue to be free but we may rate limit abusers. Also we expect multiple offchain indexer providers to exist. We open sourced our indexer code so it’s easy (and pretty cheap) to run your own at 2024-05-18 03:26:42 : replied to :2

Steve Dakh | EAS said An offchain attestation won’t modify state. You can simulate an offchain attestation to see if it would pass a resolver, but simply creating an offchain attestation won’t cost anything. at 2024-05-20 08:17:03 : replied to :3731

Maxime Servais said Is there any API out there to easily retrieve attestations for a given wallet across all chains?

I basically would like to know all attestations a wallet has received, e.g. coinbase verification (which is an attestation on Base), gitcoin passport (which is an attestation on OP Mainnet), etc.

I could of course query the EAS Graphql API myself but maybe someone has built something to give an overview of a wallet's attestations across chains? at 2024-05-21 18:08:03 : replied to :2

Sharfy said hey guys! I'm using the celo graphql api to query attestations based on the recipient address, and I noticed that it takes in recipient addresses as case sensitive. usually case sensitivity for addresses is used as an optional checksum. on celo.easscan I noticed that I can search for both the "all lowercased" version, or the "case sensitive" version, and it returns the same attestation correctly. however this is not the case for the graphql API, if I search for the "all lowercased" version, it doesn't return any data, only if I send in the "case sensitive" version. is this something that will be changed in the future? thank you in advance. 🙂 at 2024-05-22 02:40:07 : replied to :2

None said Totally make sense. Let me try to clear things from my personal understanding.

Issuer will attest the root of the merkle tree and send the tree dump back to the holder (aka requester). At this point, only issuer and holder have the full raw data of the tree.

So when the holder want to send selective disclosure of the attestation to the verifier, they don't send the full tree but proof of selected leaves.

With this proof, verifiers will be able to see the raw leaf data and confirm the root at 2024-05-29 17:37:22 : replied to :3847

What I'm looking for is a clearly published reference of a Merkle tree in JSON so that everyone in any language can make and exchange a correct one.

It's also important to nail down the type, whether that single field is enough or whether it should use conventions of HTTP, e.g. MIME types for binary formats, whether to assume UTF-8 and base-64 for strings, whether timestamps or numbers should all be turned to strings before hashing and if so then RFC-3339. at 2024-05-30 00:52:46 : replied to :2

Luke Puplett said This is interesting. Thank you.

I'm still not sure about it as a data exchange format. If there was a selfie in here then the receiver of the proof would not know how to decode the bytes. Potentially, I'd have to either ABI-encode a struct which contains a contentType field and a data field, or I'd have to include the contentType as a leaf node.

I'd prefer the JSON was immediately understandable by a human, so a developer could look at the JSON and write the code to prove it with only the knowledge of how a Merkle tree works and the obviousness of the JSON itself.

Or even, present the JSON to an LLM and have the LLM understand it and write the code to deserialize it and prove it.

If we want to build blockchain apps that attract ALL the world's developers, we need to focus on developer experience and less esoteric concepts.

Anyway, you've been very helpful, thank you!! at 2024-05-30 14:22:53 : replied to :2

And that the JSON (or whatever) must contain all the information needed for data exchange.

The "big rock first", I think, is the ability to encode a photo into a leaf node such that the reader of the JSON has all the information to be able to decode and present the photo in a UI, or to be able tell that some base-64 is actually an ANSI/NIST-ITL biometric data file. at 2024-05-30 18:01:59 : replied to :2
